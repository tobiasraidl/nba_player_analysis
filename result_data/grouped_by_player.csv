In June 2013, he was selected by the Thunder with the 12th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft. Steven Adams was born in Rotorua, New Zealand, to a Tongan mother and an English father. His father, Sid Adams, served in the Royal Navy and later settled in New Zealand where he fathered 18 children with five women.Sid Adams stood 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) tall, and his children inherited his height: Steven Adams' brothers average 2.06 m (6 ft 9 in) tall, while his sisters average 1.83 m (6 ft 0 in).His half-sister, Valerie Adams, is a dual Olympic gold medalist and four-time world champion shot-putter,while his brothers, Warren and Sid Jr., had careers in the New Zealand National Basketball League.Sid Adams was in his sixties when his youngest child Steven was born, and he died in 2006 of stomach cancer.Adams has identified his father's death as one of the defining events of his life. In a 2012 interview, Adams recalled: After the death of his father, his brother Warren rescued him from the streets of Rotorua and brought him to Wellington.Warren began to take responsibility for Adams and introduced him to Wellington basketball legend Kenny McFadden. McFadden accepted Adams into his basketball academy, and Warren enrolled him in Scots College. The only rule McFadden had for Adams was that he had to attend school every day if he wanted to play basketball. While there was pressure for Adams to turn professional straight out of high school because it was believed he would never be able to qualify for the NCAA, Adams did well at Scots College and passed through the NCAA Clearinghouse after graduating from Scots in December 2011.In 2011, Adams played for the Wellington Saints of the National Basketball League.He went unpaid by the Saints in order to keep his college eligibility.He was named the NBL Rookie of the Year and helped the Saints win the championship.

285,44,LaMarcus Aldridge,LaMarcus Nurae Aldridge,F-C,6-11,260.0,July 19 1985,"Dallas, Texas",False,/players/a/aldrila01.html,27.0,"[25, 27]","LaMarcus Nurae Aldridge (born July 19, 1985) is an American professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The power forward played college basketball for two seasons with the Texas Longhorns. Aldridge was selected second overall in the 2006 NBA draft. After spending nine seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, he signed with the Spurs in 2015. He has been selected to five All-NBA teams and is a seven-time NBA All-Star. He is widely known for his signature fadeaway jump shot.Aldridge attended Seagoville High School, where he became a second-team Parade All-American and Texas Association of Basketball Coaches (TABC) Class 4A Player of the Year. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Aldridge was listed as the No. 4 best center and the No. 16 player in the nation in 2004.Aldridge attended the University of Texas at Austin.He declared for the 2004 NBA draft but ultimately withdrew his name.According to one report, Aldridge's initial decision to attend college rather than entering the pro ranks directly from high school was influenced by Shaquille O'Neal's personal advice that he should go to college and then evaluate his NBA prospects.However, in April 2006, after the end of his second year with the Longhorns, Aldridge announced that he would leave college to enter the 2006 NBA draft.Aldridge was drafted second overall in the 2006 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls, only to have his rights traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for their pick, Tyrus Thomas, and Viktor Khryapa, shortly after. The Bulls acquired the pick from the New York Knicks in the 2005 Eddy Curry trade. Aldridge missed the first seven games of the 2006–07 NBA season due to off-season shoulder surgery, but returned ahead of schedule due in part to an injury to fellow rookie teammate Brandon Roy. Aldridge made an immediate impact on offense, averaging 8.4 points on 54% shooting from the field through his first 14 games. After the loss of starting center Joel Przybilla, in February 2007 to season-ending knee surgery, Aldridge was awarded the starting center position and improved his scoring to 14.7 points with 8.0 rebounds per game in the month of March. This placed him second in the voting for the Western Conference Rookie of the Month to Roy. On March 31, 2007, in the first quarter against the Los Angeles Clippers, Aldridge was taken to Providence Hospital in Portland for shortness of breath and irregular heartbeat. He was diagnosed with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome on April 9 and missed the remaining eight games of the 2006–07 season.Aldridge started 22 games his rookie season.Aldridge was one of six players named to the 2007 NBA All-Rookie first team; he tied for fifth place with Toronto Raptors player Jorge Garbajosa. Aldridge elevated his play in his second season, with career highs in points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals, and finished third in voting for the NBA Most Improved Player Award. During this season, Aldridge had injury troubles due to plantar fasciitis, which caused him to miss games from December 11 to 18, 2007. After the time missed, Aldridge still had some trouble with the foot but was able to play effectively. Aldridge played inconsistently to start the season, adjusting to more defensive pressure. He called the first 15 games ""the worst funk"" of his life but gradually improved as the season went on. Aldridge developed his offensive game over the course of the season, still relying heavily on his midrange fade away shot. He finished the season averaging 18.1 points and 7.5 rebounds. Aldridge scored over 20 points in half of the last 28 games of the season. For his first time in the league Aldridge nearly played a full season, missing only one game. In late October, Aldridge signed a five-year, $65 million contract extension with Portland. Before committing to Aldridge, the Trail Blazers finalized a five-year, $80 million deal with All-Star Brandon Roy. Aldridge put up similar numbers to the previous season. Early in December, Greg Oden suffered a season-ending injury. Aldridge received more minutes and offensive opportunities as a result. Aldridge further emerged as both a player and a leader after Brandon Roy went out with knee problems in December 2010. In spite of Portland's ""send LA to LA"" program – the NBA All-Star game was in Los Angeles and Aldridge's nickname is ""L-A"" – Aldridge failed to get named to the Western Conference squad. He was, however, awarded the NBA Player of the Week for January 17–23 and February 7–13, and scored a career-high 42 points against the Chicago Bulls on February 7, 2011. On March 2, he joined Clyde Drexler (1991) and Kelvin Ransey (1981) as the only Blazers to ever receive the NBA Player of the Month award. Aldridge was runner-up to Kevin Love for the Most Improved Player Award, and voted to the All-NBA Third Team with 135 votes. Due to the lockout, the 2011–12 season did not start until Christmas Day 2011. Blazer fans were hopeful that the three players advertised in their ""Rise With Us"" promotional campaign (Aldridge, Roy, and Greg Oden) would finally have a chance to play together for a ""full"" season. Those plans evaporated when Roy, who suffered from chronic knee problems due to the lack of cartilage in them, retired and Oden, who had only played in 82 games in the previous four seasons, had yet another setback in his effort to rehabilitate his knees. Aldridge was named a reserve on the Western Conference All-Star team in 2012. On November 12, 2012, Aldridge recorded a career-high eight assists in an 87-95 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. In 2013, Aldridge was named an All-Star for the second time in his career. He averaged 21.1 points per game, a career-high 9.1 rebounds per game and also recorded a career-high 2.6 assists per game in 37.7 minutes per game. The Trail Blazers went 33-49 and missed the playoffs for the second straight year. Despite trade rumors during the 2013 offseason, Aldridge voiced his desire to stay put in Portland, while also asking for improvements to the Blazers' roster. Aldridge started out his eighth NBA season strong, recording five straight double-doubles from November 9 to 17. On November 23, 2013, in a game against the Warriors, Aldridge was involved in an altercation after Warriors center Andrew Bogut became entangled with Joel Freeland. On November 25, it was announced that he was fined $45,000 for escalating the incident. The very same day, Aldridge was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the fourth time in his career. The award came in the midst of an 11-game win streak for the Blazers, during which Aldridge averaged 21.1 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 2.5 blocks per game. On December 12, 2013, Aldridge scored 31 points and grabbed a career-high 25 rebounds in a 111–104 victory over the Houston Rockets, becoming the first player in Portland Trail Blazers franchise history with at least 30 points and 25 rebounds in a game. On January 23, 2014, Aldridge recorded a career-high 44 points along with 13 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 blocks in a 110-105 victory over the Denver Nuggets. The Trail Blazers went 31-10 over the first half of the 2014 season, consistently staying near the top of the Western Conference through the first three months of the season, and making a push for a return to the playoffs. Alongside teammate Damian Lillard, Aldridge was voted in as a reserve for the 2014 NBA All-Star Game, his third straight appearance. He finished fifth in the frontcourt fan voting, garnering over 600,000 votes. Aldridge suffered a lower back contusion during the third quarter of a game versus the San Antonio Spurs on March 12, 2014. He missed the next seven games but returned in time to help the Blazers secure their 30th playoff berth and first since 2011. On April 20, 2014, Aldridge recorded a new career high and franchise playoff high of 46 points along with 18 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks in Game 1 of the opening round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets which ended in a 122-120 overtime win for the Portland Trail Blazers. On April 23, 2014, in Game 2 of the Blazers' series against the Houston Rockets, Aldridge tallied 43 points and 8 rebounds. He joins Michael Jordan, Jerry West, Allen Iverson, and Tracy McGrady as the only players in NBA history to score 89 or more points in the first two games of a playoff series. Over the entire six-game series with Houston, Aldridge averaged 29.8 points and over 2.5 blocks per game. In the next series against the Spurs, Aldridge struggled, shooting only 41.7 percent from the field, as the Blazers were handily defeated in five games. Ultimately, Aldridge had a career season in 2014, winning three Western Conference Player of the Week awards, and recording career highs in points per game, rebounds per game, free-throw percentage, defensive rebounds, and double-doubles. On December 9, 2014, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Aldridge passed Terry Porter for second on the franchise's all-time scoring list with 11,333 career points. After leading Portland over the first half of the season with averages of 23.2 points and 10.2 rebounds per game, Aldridge was ruled out for six to eight weeks on January 23, 2015, after tearing the radial collateral ligament in his left thumb. However, he missed just two games after deciding against surgery and returned to the starting lineup on January 24 against the Washington Wizards, scoring 26 points in a victory that followed two losses with him sidelined. After being selected as a frontcourt reserve to his fourth straight NBA All-Star Game appearance on January 29, Aldridge was named as a starter on February 14 by Western Conference All-Star head coach Steve Kerr, replacing the injured Anthony Davis. On March 20, 2015, Aldridge became the Trail Blazers' all-time leader in rebounds by recording 10 against the Orlando Magic. Meanwhile, however, the Blazers were cooling off after a 30-11 record through the first 41 games of the season when shooting guard Wesley Matthews, who Aldridge called ""the heart and soul"" of the Trail Blazers, tore his Achilles tendon on March 5 against the Dallas Mavericks and missed the rest of the season and playoffs, The Blazers subsequently went 21-20 through their final 41 games. In the playoffs, the short-handed Blazers were outplayed and outmatched by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games. Aldridge averaged a career-best 23.4 points per game, made a league-best 659 field goals, and was voted onto the All-NBA Second Team. On July 9, 2015, Aldridge signed a four-year, $80 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs. Upon being acquired by the Spurs, Aldridge was granted the number 12 jersey despite it having been retired for Bruce Bowen. Bowen gave Aldridge and the Spurs his blessing to unretire the number for him. He made his debut for the Spurs in the team's season opener on October 28 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. In just under 32 minutes of action, he recorded 11 points and 5 rebounds in a 112–106 loss. On November 11, he returned to Portland for the first time as a Spur, recording 23 points and 6 rebounds in a 113–101 win over his former team. On February 1, 2016, he scored a season-high 28 points in a 107–92 win over the Orlando Magic, helping the Spurs win its 35th straight home game (dating to March 2015), good for the sixth-best streak in league history. He topped his season-high mark two days later, scoring 36 points in a 110–97 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. With the win, the Spurs moved to 27–0 at home to start the season, snapping a tie with the 1977–78 Portland Trail Blazers for the best home start among Western Conference teams. On February 8, he was named the Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, February 1 through Sunday, February 7. He averaged 26.0 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.5 blocks while shooting .597 (37-62) from the field and .909 from the foul line to help the Spurs go 4–0 for the week. After dislocating his right pinkie finger on April 7, it bothered him for the rest of the regular season and into the playoffs. As the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference, the Spurs faced a depleted Memphis Grizzlies team in the first round. In a Game 1 win, Aldridge scored 17 points. The Spurs went on to sweep the Grizzlies in the first round to move on to the conference semi-finals, where they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder. In Game 1 of the series against the Thunder, Aldridge scored a game-high 38 points on 18-of-23 shooting in a 124–92 win. In a Game 2 loss, he bested that mark by scoring 41 points. In the Spurs' season opener on October 25, 2016, Aldridge recorded 26 points and 14 rebounds in a 129–100 win over the Golden State Warriors. His next best performance came on December 25 against the Chicago Bulls. Aldridge had a season-high 33 points in a 119–110 win over the Bulls, marking his second-highest scoring output as a Spur. He made his first nine attempts while scoring 20 points in the opening period, his most in any quarter with the Spurs. On March 11, 2017, he was ruled out for an indefinite period due to an occurrence of a minor heart arrhythmia. He was medically cleared to return on March 15. In his first game back that night, Aldridge had 19 points and seven rebounds in a 110–106 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. As a result, Aldridge reached 1,000 points for a 10th straight season, joining LeBron James and Dwyane Wade as the only active players (at the time) with that streak. On May 11, 2017, the Spurs eliminated the Houston Rockets with a 114–75 victory in Game 6 of their second-round playoff series behind a season-high 34 points from Aldridge. Aldridge had failed to get out of the second round in his previous six postseason trips. He also became the first Spur to score 34 points with 12 rebounds in a playoff game since Tim Duncan against the Phoenix Suns in 2008. The Spurs went on to lose to the Warriors in a clean sweep in the Western Conference Finals. Aldridge closed out a disappointing series with his second eight-point effort against the Warriors. He entered Game 4 averaging 18 points but was held to 4-for-11 shooting in 22 minutes in the series finale.

Anderson (born September 20, 1993)is an American professional basketball player for the Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. After earning All-American honors as a sophomore in 2013–14, he declared for the 2014 NBA draft and was selected in the first round with the 30th overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs. Anderson developed the ball-handling skills of a point guard at an early age, but his height provided him the versatility to play as a forward. As a high school player in New Jersey, Anderson led his teams to two consecutive state titles, and was named state player of the year during his senior year. One of the top recruits out of high school, Anderson was named second-team all-conference in the Pac-12 as a freshman at UCLA while playing mostly at forward. The following season, he moved to point guard, and was voted the Most Outstanding Player of the Pac-12 Tournament as the Bruins won their first conference tournament title in six years. He played four seasons with San Antonio before signing with Memphis. Anderson was born in New York City, and grew up in New Jersey in North Bergen before moving to Fairview while in high school.He started playing basketball the day he started walking, which was three days before his first birthday. He attended his first basketball camp at age three.Anderson's father, a longtime high school basketball coach in New Jersey, groomed him to be a point guard. Although Anderson was tall, his father did not want him to be ""pigeonholed"" as a post player.He had his son play with older players on Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teams; usually the smallest player on the court, Anderson developed point guard skills early while passing to his larger teammates.He began his high school career at Paterson Catholic High School. Although he possessed the skills of a point guard, his 6-foot-5-inch (1.96 m) height led coaches to play him on the wing or in the post. After two years at Paterson Catholic, the school closed, and Anderson moved to St. Anthony High School.Overall, he compiled 119–6 record as a four-year starter, including 65–0 in his two years at St. Anthony.When St. Anthony captured its second straight New Jersey Tournament of Champions title and concluded its second straight undefeated season with a 66–62 victory over Plainfield, Anderson was the team’s third-leading scorer with 14 points. Still, St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley said Anderson was the team's ""heart and soul and he was the reason we won the game.’’For the season, Anderson led the team in scoring (14.7 points per game), rebounding (6.5 per game), assists (3.9 per game), blocked shots (2.0 per game) and deflections. The Star-Ledger named him their state boys basketball Player of the Year.He received national recognition as a Parade All-American, McDonald's All-American, and he was invited to play in the Jordan Brand Classic and Nike Hoop Summit.In spite of all the praise he had received in his career, Anderson was described by Hurley as ""unassuming"", which the coach credited to Anderson's family doing a ""great job keeping him balanced.""The 6-foot-8-inch (2.03 m) Anderson was often listed as a small forward,but still considered himself a point guard. Among 2012 recruits, he was ranked the No. 1 small forward by Rivals.com, and No. 2 by ESPN.com and Scout.com behind Shabazz Muhammad. Hurley called Anderson's passing ""his best asset.""Anderson committed on September 19, 2011, to attending University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to play Division I basketball for the Bruins.He had also considered Seton Hall, Georgetown, Florida and St. John's. A major factor in his decision was UCLA coach Ben Howland's record of grooming successful point guards in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Anderson and Muhammad were the top players in the Bruins' recruiting class, which was considered the best in the nation. Howland had Anderson mostly playing off the ball, while Larry Drew II was the Bruins' primary ball handler. Playing primarily as a power forward, Anderson finished the season with averages of 9.7 points, 8.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists. Though he struggled at times under Howland's strict offense, he led the team in rebounding and was the only player ranked in the top 10 in the Pac-12 in both rebounds and assists. He was the first Pac-12 player since UCLA's Bill Walton as a senior in 1973–74 to have at least 300 rebounds and 100 assists in the same season. Anderson was named to the All-Pac-12 second team and the Pac-12 All-Freshman team. Projected by NBA executives to be chosen in the first half of the second round of the 2013 NBA draft if he declared himself eligible, Anderson gave major consideration to leaving college. Anderson decided to return to UCLA in 2013–14, which he and his family figured would be his final season in college. With a field goal percentage of just 41.6% during the previous season, he worked on improving his shooting from midrange and beyond during the offseason.New Bruins coach Steve Alford, who replaced the fired Howland, moved Anderson back to his natural position at point guard. Under Alford's new wide-open offense, he played more confidently and displayed an improved jump shot. On November 22, 2013, he had 13 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists in an 81–70 win over Morehead State; it was the school's first triple-double since Toby Bailey in 1995. On November 29, UCLA was co-champion of the Continental Tire Las Vegas Invitational with Missouri, and Anderson was named the tournament's MVP, as the Bruins started the season with a 7-0 record. On February 27, Anderson and Jordan Adams missed one game after being suspended for a violation of team rules. Anderson was honored as the Most Outstanding Player of the 2014 Pac-12 Tournament, which UCLA won for their first conference tournament title in six years. In the championship game, Anderson contributed 21 points, 15 rebounds and five assists in a 75–71 upset of No. 4 nationally ranked Arizona. ""I don’t know that I’ve ever seen [those numbers] and just one turnover for a point guard,” said Arizona coach Sean Miller of Anderson's performance. Averaging 14.9 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game, Anderson was called ""the nation's top triple-double threat"" by the Orange County Register. He led the team in both rebounds and assists and was voted the team's most valuable player (MVP). Nationally, he ranked sixth in assists and first among power conference players. Anderson was also third in the Pac-12 in rebounds and steals (1.8) per game. He was the first player in Pac-12 history to register 200 rebounds and 200 assists in a season, as well as the first Division I player with at least 500 points, 300 rebounds and 200 assists in a season. Anderson's field goal percentage improved by seven percentage points from his freshman year, while his three-point field goal percentage jump from 21 to 48 percent. The Associated Press and Sporting News named Anderson a third-team All-American, and he was voted to the All-Pac-12 first team as well as first team all-district by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). He was a finalist for the Oscar Robertson Trophy, given by USBWA to the most outstanding college player; along with Shabazz Napier, they were the only players to also be on the midseason watchlists for the Naismith College Player of the Year, John R. Wooden Award, and Bob Cousy Award. On April 16, 2014, Anderson announced that he would forgo his remaining collegiate eligibility and enter the 2014 NBA draft. While he disproved detractors who thought his style would not translate to success at the major college level, critics also said his lack of quickness would be an impediment in the NBA. Many teams projected him as a power forward, with some comparing him to Boris Diaw, a longtime NBA player with point forward skills who also plays at a leisurely pace. Generally projected as a late first-round pick, Anderson was selected in the first round with the 30th overall pick of the draft by the San Antonio Spurs, who had recently won the 2014 NBA Finals. On July 12, 2014, he signed with the Spurs and joined them for the Las Vegas Summer League. In six summer league games, he spent most of the time on the wing with some minutes at power forward, but rarely as a point guard. Anderson began the 2014–15 season as the team's lone new player, with the rest of its championship roster intact. The Spurs often rested its starters, resulting in playing time for Anderson. He made his NBA debut four games into the season, playing a team-high 31 minutes in a 98–81 loss to the Houston Rockets, while coach Gregg Popovich rested veteran stars Tim Duncan and Manu Ginóbili in the second game of a back-to-back set for the Spurs. Anderson shot just 1-of-8, but displayed his skill set with eight rebounds, four assists and two steals; he also acted as San Antonio's primary ball handler during the fourth quarter. On December 10 with five Spurs out due to a combination of injuries or rest, Anderson made his first NBA start and scored nine points in a 109–95 win over the New York Knicks. He continued to receive playing time while starting small forward Kawhi Leonard remained out for an extended period with a hand injury. During his rookie season, he has also had multiple assignments with the Austin Spurs of the NBA Development League. On February 9, he was named the D-League Performer of the Week. Austin went 2–0 that week, while Anderson logged back-to-back double-doubles and averaged 19.0 points, 11.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.5 blocks. He was named the NBA Development League Player of the Month for February, when he averaged 22.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, and 4.7 assists, leading Austin to an 8–1 record. During the offseason, Anderson played with the Spurs in the 2015 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas. In seven games, he averaged 21.0 points and 6.0 rebounds in 27.3 minutes, and was named the league's MVP. He became a regular part of San Antonio's rotation in 2015–16, appearing in 78 games while averaging 16 minutes. On March 28, 2016, he played 36 minutes and recorded 13 points, seven assists, and four steals in a 101–87 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. He established career highs in minutes and assists. Anderson had a career-high 11 rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench in an April 7 loss to the Golden State Warriors. In the regular season finale, he had his first double-double in the NBA with 15 points and 10 rebounds, leading the short-handed Spurs to a 96–91 win over the Dallas Mavericks. He matched his career-high in points, while adding a career-best five steals. Anderson participated in the Summer League again in 2016, and Spurs summer league coach Becky Hammon declared him the top player in the league. He averaged a league-high 23.7 points in three games in the Utah league, and followed up with averages of 18.5 points and six rebounds in two games in Las Vegas, when the Spurs sent him home after they were content he had nothing left to prove in the league. He played 72 games including 14 starts in 2016–17, but his overall performance regressed. The Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs in the Western Conference Finals, when Anderson scored a season-high 20 points and added seven rebounds and four steals in the season-ending Game 4 loss to the Golden State. Without any Summer League commitments for the first time as a pro, Anderson wanted to build off of his Game 4 performance. Over the summer, he worked on finishing shots around the rim and getting in shape to be light enough to play at guard or small forward while also being strong enough to also play at power forward. With Leonard out an extended period with a quadriceps injury, Anderson began 2017–18 as a starter. At Oklahoma City on December 3, 2017, Anderson started at power forward in place of a resting LaMarcus Aldridge when he went down in obvious pain after suffering a Grade I strain to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of his left knee in the third quarter. He required assistance off the floor and went directly to the locker room. He was subsequently ruled out for an estimated two weeks. Through 23 games, Anderson had been averaging career highs of 8.9 points, six rebounds and three assists. Popovich expected him to remain in the regular rotation even after Leonard returned. Anderson returned to action after missing eight games. In March 2018, he was moved to power forward as the Spurs went to a smaller lineup with Aldridge at center and Pau Gasol moving to the bench. On March 19, he was the first NBA player in the season to be scoreless and yet still post a +30 plus-minus rating in an 89–75 win over the Warriors. With Leonard missing most of the season, Anderson made 67 starts and ended the season averaging career highs in minutes (26.7 per game), points (7.9), rebounds (5.4), assists (2.7), steals (1.6), blocks (0.8) and field goal percentage (52.7). After the 2017–18 season, Anderson became a restricted free agent. He signed a four-year, $37.2 million contract with the Memphis Grizzlies after the Spurs declined to match the offer sheet. Popovich said the figure was ""beyond the pale for us"", but he was happy for Anderson. The Grizzlies' interest was strengthened by Memphis assistant coach Chad Forcier, a former Spurs assistant who Popovich credited along with Chip Engelland for developing Anderson. Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace called Anderson their ""main target"" in free agency, and vice president of basketball operations John Hollinger cited the value in his ballhandling and playmaking ability. Anderson's role as a point forward increased in his last year with San Antonio, who were 14–2 during his four years when he had five or more assists. On November 10, 2018, Anderson had eight points and a career-high 13 rebounds in a 112–106 overtime win over the Philadelphia 76ers. He followed up with a second straight game with 13 rebounds in a loss to the Utah Jazz. In his first return to San Antonio on November 21, Anderson had nine points and nine rebounds in a team-high 38 minutes in a 104–103 win over the Spurs. In January 2019, he missed two weeks with an ankle injury. He returned for two games before being sidelined beginning in February with a nagging shoulder injury. In April, he underwent thoracic outlet decompression surgery to address his right shoulder soreness and other affiliated symptoms. Anderson was still experiencing discomfort from the shoulder surgery as preseason began in 2019–20, and there were doubts on his health for the upcoming season. However, his recovery went well during the regular season. Anderson participated in U16 and U17 training camps for USA Basketball prior to being named to the 2009–10 USA Basketball Men's Developmental National Team. In 2012, he started at power forward for the USA Basketball Junior National Select Team that competed at the Nike Hoop Summit, which featured the top American high school seniors against a team of international players aged 19 or younger. Out of high school, Anderson was considered capable of playing any of four positions on the court, from point guard to power forward, drawing comparisons to basketball legends Magic Johnson. Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, ""I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But you let him do a lot of what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on the little guy. Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a step-out player."" During his sophomore year in UCLA, CBSSports.com wrote that Anderson was ""starting to look more and more like the Magic Johnson of the 2013–14 season in college basketball."" ESPN analyst Dick Vitale warned against calling him the next Magic Johnson, but stated that ""he has the mini-version of that kind of skill.” USA Today commented that he was ""kind of a poor man's Magic Johnson"". The Seattle Times called Anderson the ""[m]ost versatile player in years in the Pac-12."" In 2014, SI.com said he ""[m]ight be the most versatile player in the country."" Rarely has a player of Anderson's stature—standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) with a wingspan of 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 m)—been entrusted to run the offense of a college team. He was a unique talent with a size advantage to post up smaller defenders down low, and the ball-handling skills to run the offense from the top of the key. He was comfortable playing both in the post and on the perimeter, and could direct the offense as either a point guard or point forward. One of the top rebounding guards in college, Anderson was the rare point guard that could rebound the ball and single-handedly initiate a fast break. He was often described as a ""nightmare"" matchup for opponents. Anderson plays at a deliberate pace, and he is not as fast as more athletically gifted players. Popovich stated that he is ""not what you’d call a typical NBA athlete"". However, Anderson is praised for his basketball IQ. He is able to change speeds and fake out his opponents to keep them off balance. His methodical style earned him the nickname ""Slow Mo"" in eighth grade in AAU, and the name has stuck with him. "" really understands how to use his speed—he's not super fast, but he's super bright and really knows how to use angles,"" said Kevin Boyle, who coached Anderson on the national team in 2012. USA Today described him as ""languid but quick enough to lead the fast break"". Anderson's defense was considered a weakness. In college, his teams usually played zone as he struggled containing smaller, quicker guards while playing man-to-man. His defense improved with the Spurs in 2017–18, when he guarded both forward positions while leveraging his wingspan and instincts. Anderson is the son of Kyle Sr. and Suzanne Anderson. His grandfather, Clifton Anderson, played college football at Indiana and had a two-year professional career in the National Football League (NFL) with the Chicago Cardinals in 1952 and the New York Giants in 1953.Anderson's maternal grandmother grew up in Jamaica; her father was Chinese and married a Jamaican woman, and they lived in Jamaica among the Chinese Jamaicans.",26080,98,2019-20,49.0,10.0,890.0,4.4,8.9,0.502,0.4,1.7,0.209,4.1,7.1,0.574,1.5,2.3,0.655,1.9,6.4,8.3,4.2,1.5,1.0,1.7,3.0,10.8,15.0,Memphis Grizzlies

Born in Greece to Nigerian parents, Antetokounmpo began playing basketball for the youth teams of Filathlitikos in Athens. In 2011, he began playing for the club's senior team before entering the 2013 NBA Draft, where he was selected 15th overall by the Bucks. Antetokounmpo's combination of size, speed and ball-handling skills led to his nickname the ""Greek Freak"". In 2016–17 he led the Bucks in all five major statistical categories and became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all five statistics of total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.He received the Most Improved Player award in 2017. He has received four All-Star selections, including being selected as the Eastern Conference captain for 2020, and led the Eastern Conference in voting in 2019. In June 2019, he was named the NBA Most Valuable Player. Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6, 1994, the son of immigrants from Nigeria.Three years earlier, his parents had moved from Lagos, leaving behind their firstborn son, Francis, with his grandparents.Though Antetokounmpo and three of his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically receive full Greek citizenship as the Greek nationality law abides by the jus sanguinis.For the first 18 years of his life Antetokounmpo was effectively stateless, having no papers from Nigeria or Greece.Antetokounmpo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia.His parents, as immigrants, could not easily find work, so Antetokounmpo and his older brother, Thanasis, helped by hawking watches, handbags and sunglasses in the streets. In 2007, Antetokounmpo started playing basketball,and was playing competitively for the youth squad of Filathlitikos by 2009. In 2011 Antetokounmpo played with the senior men's team of Filathlitikos in the semi-pro Greek B Basket League (third Division) during the 2011–12 season. In the 2012–13 season he played in the Greek A2 League, Greece's second division. In December 2012, a few days after turning 18, Antetokounmpo signed a four-year deal with Spanish club CAI Zaragoza, reportedly including NBA buyouts after each season. A number of other major European clubs had been interested in adding him, including Barcelona and Efes.With the contract starting with the 2013–14 season, he decided to stay with the Filathlitikos for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. During the 2012–13 Greek A2 League season, Antetokounmpo shot 46.4% from the field (62.1% on two-point field goals), 31.3% from three-point range, and 72.0% from the free throw line, while averaging 22.5 minutes per game. Over 26 games, he averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game. He was also selected by the coaches as a special participant in the 2013 Greek League All-Star Game. Even though he was not actually selected as an all-star, the coaches let him play in the game as a treat for the fans. On April 28, 2013, Antetokounmpo officially made himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft. He fulfilled his draft projections as a first-round pick by being selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. On July 30, 2013, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks. Antetokounmpo made his NBA debut on October 13, 2013 at the age of 18 years, 311 days, as one of the youngest NBA players ever. He averaged 6.8 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.8 steals, and 0.8 blocks in 77 appearances during his rookie season. He scored in double figures 23 times and grabbed 10+ rebounds twice, with both efforts resulting in double-doubles. He finished the season with 61 total blocks, which led all NBA rookies and was the seventh-most by a Bucks rookie in franchise history. He was selected to participate in the Rising Stars Challenge at NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans, where he tallied nine points, two rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes. At the season's end, he was named to the 2013–14 NBA All-Rookie second team. On October 16, 2014, the Bucks exercised their third-year team option on Antetokounmpo's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season. On February 6, 2015, he recorded a then career-high 27 points and 15 rebounds in a loss to the Houston Rockets. Three days later, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played February 2–8, earning Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career. He later competed in the 2015 NBA Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All-Star Weekend in New York. On March 9, he scored a then career-high 29 points on 11-of-16 shooting in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. The Bucks finished the regular season with a 41–41 record, good for sixth in the Eastern Conference. He missed just one game during the 2014–15 season, averaging 12.7 points and 6.7 rebounds in 81 games. In the Bucks' first round playoff match-up with the Chicago Bulls, they were defeated 4 games to 2. On August 1, 2015, Antetokounmpo played for Team Africa in the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game, representing Nigeria due to his parents being born there. On October 26, 2015, the Bucks exercised their fourth-year team option on Antetokounmpo's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season.

On March 13, he recorded his fourth triple-double in 11 games with 28 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 14 assists in a 109–100 win over the Brooklyn Nets, becoming the first Bucks player with four triple-doubles in a season. On April 1, he recorded his fifth triple-double of the season with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in a 113–110 win over the Orlando Magic. Two days later, he scored a career-high 34 points in a 102–98 loss to the Chicago Bulls. On September 19, 2016, Antetokounmpo agreed to a four-year, $100 million contract extension with the Bucks.

On January 19, Antetokounmpo was named a starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. On February 10, 2017, Antetokounmpo set a new career high with 41 points in a 122–114 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. On February 19, 2017, he became the Bucks' first All-Star since Michael Redd in 2004, and the first starter since Sidney Moncrief in 1986. At 22 years and 74 days old, he became the youngest player in franchise history to start in an All-Star Game. He also became the first Greek NBA All-Star. In the game, he led the East with 30 points in a 192–182 loss to the West. On April 3, 2017, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games played in March. The award marked the first of Antetokounmpo's career and the first for a Buck since Michael Redd won the award in January 2004. Antetokounmpo joined Redd, Terry Cummings (January 1985) and Sidney Moncrief (December 1981) as the only four Bucks players to be named Eastern Conference Player of the Month. Antetokounmpo helped the Bucks finish an Eastern Conference-best 14–4 in March, the franchise's first calendar month with at least 14 victories since going 16–2 in February 1971. He averaged 22.4 points (ninth in the East), 8.4 rebounds (10th in the East), 4.8 assists, 1.78 blocked shots (fourth in the East) and 1.33 steals in 18 games during the month.

He also became the first player in NBA history to finish in the top 20 in the league in each of the five major categories in a regular season. As a result of his efforts, Antetokounmpo was named to the All-NBA Second Team, earning his first All-NBA honor. He was also named the recipient of the NBA Most Improved Player Award for the 2016–17 season, becoming the first player in Bucks history to be named Most Improved Player.

The Bucks went on to lose Game 6 three days later despite a 34-point effort from Antetokounmpo, as they bowed out of the playoffs with a 4–2 defeat. In the Bucks' season opener on October 18, 2017, Antetokounmpo had 37 points and 13 rebounds in a 108–100 win over the Boston Celtics. Three days later, he scored a career-high 44 points in a 113–110 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

In the Bucks' fourth game of the season on October 23, Antetokounmpo had 32 points and 14 rebounds in a 103–94 win over the Charlotte Hornets, thus registering at least 30 points in each of his first four games. His 147 points through the first four games are the most in team history—Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 146 in 1970–71. Coming into the sixth game of the season, he had 175 points, 53 rebounds and 28 assists, the best start by a player in NBA history through his first five games.

On January 15, 2018, he recorded 27 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in a 104–95 win over the Wizards, becoming the second-youngest Buck to record a 20-20 game behind Andrew Bogut. Three days later, he was named a starter for the 2018 NBA All-Star Game, becoming the first Buck since Marques Johnson (1979–80) to be named a starter in two straight All-Star Games. On February 15, 2018, he recorded his first triple-double of the season with 36 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists in a 134–123 loss to the Denver Nuggets. It was his ninth career triple-double, passing Abdul-Jabbar for most in Bucks history. In Game 1 of the Bucks' first-round playoff series against the Celtics, Antetokounmpo recorded 35 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists in a 113–107 overtime loss. In Game 6, Antetokounmpo had 31 points and 14 rebounds, as the Bucks pulled away late to beat the Celtics 97–86 to force Game 7. The Bucks were eliminated from the playoffs with a 112–96 loss in Game 7, despite Antetokounmpo's 22 points and nine rebounds. On October 24, 2018, Antetokounmpo had 32 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists in a 123–108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, helping the Bucks improve to 4–0 for the first time since the 2001–02 season. It was his fourth straight 25-point, 15-rebound performance to start the season, becoming the first player since Wilt Chamberlain (in 1964–65 with the Philadelphia 76ers) to accomplish the feat. In four games between November 19–25, he scored at least 29 points in each contest. On December 14, he matched his career high with 44 points in a 114–102 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

He was named the Euroscar European Player of the Year for 2018, becoming the second Greek player to receive the award since Nikos Galis in 1987. On January 9, 2019, he scored 27 points and grabbed a season-high 21 rebounds in a 116–109 win over the Houston Rockets. On February 13, he recorded his fifth triple-double of the season with 33 points, 19 rebounds and 11 assists in a 106–97 win over the Indiana Pacers.

He helped the Bucks advance to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2001 after scoring 41 points in a 127–104 win in Game 4 over the Detroit Pistons for a four-game sweep. He became the fifth player in Bucks history to score 40-plus in a playoff game, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Terry Cummings, Ray Allen and Michael Redd. The Bucks went on to reach the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by the Raptors despite winning the first two games. At the NBA's end-of-season awards night, Antetokounmpo was named the league's Most Valuable Player. He joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the second Bucks player to win MVP, and became the third-youngest player to win the MVP over the previous 40 seasons, behind Derrick Rose and LeBron James. He also became the fifth player born outside of the United States to win MVP. Early in the 2019–20 season on December 19, 2019, Antetokounmpo made a career-high five three-pointers to lead Milwaukee over the Lakers and claimed the NBA's best record at 25–4. Afterwards, he stated that he needed to ""stay humble"" despite his continued success, explaining that he ""wasn't supposed to be here"", having not been a No. 1 draft pick like the Lakers' James and Anthony Davis. Antetokounmpo represented Greece for the first time in July 2013 with the Greek Under-20 national team at the 2013 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship.

He has been named an NBA All-Star ten times and an All-NBA Team member six times. He played college basketball for the Syracuse Orange, winning a national championship as a freshman in 2003 while being named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. After one season at Syracuse, Anthony entered the 2003 NBA draft and was selected with the third overall pick by the Denver Nuggets. While playing for Denver, he led the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 2004 to 2010; the team won two division titles in that span. In 2009, Anthony led the Nuggets to their first Conference Finals appearance since 1985. In 2011, he was traded from Denver to the New York Knicks days before the NBA trade deadline. In a January 24, 2014 game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Anthony scored a career-high 62 points, setting a Knicks' single-game scoring record and a Madison Square Garden single-game scoring record.Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he played one season before signing with the Rockets. Anthony has played in the Olympics for the US national team a record four times, winning a bronze medal with the 2004 squad and gold medals on the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic teams. As of April 2016, he was the US Olympic team's all-time leader in points,rebounds, and games played.Anthony was born in the Red Hook housing projects in Brooklyn, New York City.His father, Carmelo Iriarte, was born in Manhattan to Puerto Rican parents. Iriarte was of African, Spanish, and indigenous ancestry; some of his roots also traced to Venezuela.His mother, Mary Anthony, is African-American. Iriarte died of cancer when Anthony was two years old. When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore, where he honed not only his athletic skills, but his survival skills. Kenny Minor, one of Anthony's childhood friends, said, ""from drugs to killings, to anything you can name that goes on in the roughest parts of town, we've seen and witnessed hands on. Those are the things that teach you toughness and keep you mentally focused on your goals."" Sports would serve as an important diversion from the violence and drug dealing that were pervasive in the housing projects a few blocks from the homes of Anthony and his friends. Anthony commuted to Towson Catholic High School for his first three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches into the frame of a 6–5 swingman. He suddenly became one of the area's top players and made a name for himself in the area, being named The Baltimore Sun's metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered a blip on the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year. After his junior year, Division I coaches were lined up to recruit Anthony to a school on the East Coast, which included North Carolina and Syracuse. In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady or Amar'e Stoudemire, he decided to declare early and announce that he would attend Syracuse University before his senior year. As Anthony's grades dropped under a C average and his scores on the ACT were below acceptable standards, he knew that he needed to improve in the classroom to qualify academically for Syracuse. For his senior year, his mother considered transferring him to a different school. Anthony first thought of Virginia's Hargrave Military Academy but after talking to Steve Smith, the head coach at basketball powerhouse Oak Hill Academy, he eventually transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia—winner of the USA Today 2000–01 high school championship—for his senior campaign. During the summer of 2001, Anthony led an AAU Baltimore Select team to the Final Four of the Adidas Big Time Tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada. Anthony attracted attention from the NBA by averaging 25.2 points a game in the tournament, which was also attended by Amar'e Stoudemire (who was already being touted as a future lottery pick). Anthony played at the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival where he helped the East Team win the silver medal. He tied LeBron James for the tournament scoring lead at 24 points per game and shot 66 percent from the field. It was there that Anthony and James struck up a friendship. Oak Hill Academy entered the 2001–02 campaign boasting a 42-game winning streak. The team's first tournament win came in The Les Schwab Invitational against Mater Dei High School from Santa Ana, California, with Anthony winning the tournament MVP. Oak Hill won two more big-time tournaments, including the Nike Academy National Invitational where they knocked off then-No. 1 Westchester High School 77–61 in the final, and an anticipated game against St. Vincent – St. Mary High School of Akron, Ohio, where he was matched up with high school phenom LeBron James. James scored 36 points, while Anthony scored 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Oak Hill to a 72–66 win. The team ended the season ranked third in the country at 32–1, with their only loss coming in a rematch against Mater Dei, which ended their unbeaten streak at 67. He averaged 21.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists during his senior year at Oak Hill and named a USA Today All-USA First Team and a Parade First-Team All-American. He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic, scoring a game-high 27 points, and the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game, where he played on the same team with two future New York Knicks teammates, Raymond Felton and Amar'e Stoudemire. In that game, he scored 19 points and won the Sprite Slam Jam dunk contest. His performances at the high school All-Star games, helped lift his reputation with HoopScoop ranking him as the nation's No. 1 high school senior in the class of 2002, ranked second by College Basketball News and third by All-Star Sports. Due to his struggles with the ACT, his family and friends wondered whether Anthony would forget about his college plans to attend Syracuse and move on to the NBA. He had yet to produce the minimum score of 18; however, in late April Anthony got a 19 and decided to stick with college and prepared for his freshman year at Syracuse. In April 2009, he was named to the ESPN RISE's all-decade team and was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans in January 2012. Anthony played one season at Syracuse University, during the 2002–03 season, where he averaged 22.2 points (16th in the NCAA, fourth in the Big East) and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, third in the Big East, first among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen to their first ever NCAA tournament title in 2003. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted. Anthony's 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman. In the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds. For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament's Most Outstanding Player Award. Afterwards, Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim described Anthony as by far, the best player in college basketball. It wasn't even close. Nobody was even close to him last year in college basketball. That's the bottom line"". Anthony said that he originally planned to stay at Syracuse for two to three seasons, but having already accomplished everything he set out to do, he chose to abandon his collegiate career (with Boeheim's blessing) and declared himself eligible for the 2003 NBA draft. Some of Anthony's highlights in his time with Syracuse include being named Second-Team All-American by the Associated Press as a freshman, leading his team to a 30–5 record, capturing the school's first ever NCAA title and being the consensus pick for NCAA Freshman of the Year. He was also named to the All-Big East First Team and was the consensus selection for the Big East Conference Freshman of the Year as so as unanimous selection for Big East All Rookie Team. Anthony's NBA career began on June 26, 2003, when he was chosen third overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. He was selected behind LeBron James (first overall, Cleveland Cavaliers) and Darko Miličić (second overall, Detroit Pistons). He made his NBA regular season debut on October 29, 2003, in an 80–72 home win against the San Antonio Spurs. Anthony finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and three assists. In just his sixth career NBA game (November 7 versus the Los Angeles Clippers), Anthony scored 30 points, becoming the second youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points or more in a game (19 years, 151 days; Kobe Bryant was the youngest). It was the fewest games a Nuggets rookie took to score 30 points in a contest since the ABA–NBA merger. On February 9, 2004, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony became the third-youngest player to reach the 1,000-point plateau in NBA history with a 20-point effort in an 86–83 win. On February 13, 2004, Anthony participated in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge at All-Star Weekend. On March 30, 2004, he scored 41 points against the Seattle SuperSonics to set a new Denver Nuggets franchise record for most points in a game by a rookie. He also became the second-youngest player (19 years, 305 days) to score at least 40 points in a game in NBA history. After winning the Rookie of the Month award for the Western Conference in the month of April, Anthony became the fourth player in NBA history to capture all six of the Rookie of the Month awards in a season. The others to do so were David Robinson, Tim Duncan and fellow rookie LeBron James. Anthony was also named NBA Player of the Week twice (March 10, 2004 – March 14, 2004, and April 6, 2004 – April 10, 2004) and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection. Anthony averaged 21.0 points per game during the season, which was more than any other rookie. Anthony was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting, finishing runner-up to the Cavaliers rookie standout, James. Anthony played a major part in the turnaround of the Denver Nuggets from league laughingstock to playoff contender. In the season before Anthony was drafted by the team, the Nuggets finished with a 17–65 record, which tied them for worst in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. They finished the 2003–04 campaign with a 43–39 overall record, qualifying them as the eighth seed for the playoffs. Anthony became the first NBA rookie to lead a playoff team in scoring since David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs during the 1989–90 season. In the 2004 NBA Playoffs, the Nuggets faced the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in the First Round. In Anthony's first career playoff game, he had 19 points, six rebounds, and three assists, in a 106–92 loss at Minnesota. The Timberwolves eliminated the Nuggets in five games. In Anthony's second season, he averaged 20.8 points per game, ranking him 19th in the NBA. Anthony placed 16th in the NBA for points per 48 minutes. On December 4, 2004, versus the Miami Heat, Anthony became the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career points. Only James and Bryant were younger when they reached that plateau. Anthony played again in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, this time suiting up for the sophomore squad. In front of his home fans of Denver (who were hosting the 2005 All-Star Game), Anthony scored a game-high 31 points to go along with five boards, two assists and two steals, en route to becoming the MVP of the game. With Anthony's help, the Nuggets improved their season record by six games from the previous season, ending with a mark of 49–33. The Nuggets finished seventh place in the Western Conference (one spot higher than they finished the previous season). Denver faced the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the First Round, winning the first game in San Antonio, 93–87. However, the eventual NBA champion Spurs won the next four games, eliminating the Nuggets from the playoffs. Anthony played and started in 80 games during the 2005–06 season. He averaged 26.5 points (eighth, NBA), 2.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. His eighth-place finish in NBA scoring was the highest finish by a Denver player since the 1990–91 season, when Nuggets guard Michael Adams finished the season sixth in NBA scoring. On November 23, 2005, with the Nuggets facing the two-time defending Eastern Conference Champion Detroit Pistons, Anthony hauled down his 1,000th career rebound. A month later, Anthony recorded a then career-high 45 points in a losing effort against the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 17, 2006, versus the Memphis Grizzlies, he scored 33 points to push his career point total over the 5,000 mark. Also, in doing so, he became the second youngest player to accomplish that feat (behind LeBron James). As the month of March came to a close, the Nuggets finished 11–5, and Anthony was named as the NBA Player of the Month for March. He also took home Player of the Week honors for March 13, 2006 – March 19, 2006. During the season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds: at Houston on January 8, 2006; at home versus Phoenix on January 10; at Minnesota on February 24; at Indiana on March 15; at home versus the Los Angeles Lakers on April 6. All five of those game-winners were made on jump shots, while the shot against Minnesota was a three-point field goal. Anthony also made a shot in the final seconds to force overtime vs. the Dallas Mavericks on January 6. He made shots in the final 22 seconds against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 18, 2006, and the Philadelphia 76ers on March 9, which gave the Nuggets leads they would never lose. Anthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the season, alongside Phoenix' Shawn Marion, Houston's Yao Ming, Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Washington's Gilbert Arenas. The Nuggets finished the season in third place, winning the Northwest Division for the first time in Anthony's career. Denver faced the sixth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers in the First Round of the playoffs. The Clippers held home court advantage in the series, due to ending the regular season with a better record (Denver finished 44–38; Los Angeles finished 47–35). The Clippers won the first two games of the series on their home floor. The Nuggets split their games at home in Denver (winning game three; losing game four). Denver then lost game five at Los Angeles, which eliminated the Nuggets from the playoffs. After the season, Anthony signed a 5-year, $80 million extension with the Nuggets. In the eighth game of the season (a 117–109 home win against the Toronto Raptors), Anthony tied the franchise record of six-straight 30-point games recorded by Alex English (1982–83 season). Coincidentally, Alex English witnessed Anthony tie his record as English was an Assistant Coach at the time with the Toronto Raptors. Anthony fell short of establishing a new record in his ninth game (a 113–109 home victory over the Chicago Bulls) on November 21, as he finished with 29 points. After the Chicago victory, Anthony again tied the club record of six-straight 30-point games, failing to break it the second time around, as he scored 24 points in his 16th game (a 98–96 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks) on December 6. During a game at Madison Square Garden on December 16, Anthony was one of many players involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl. Footage showed Anthony laying a punch on the face of New York's Mardy Collins and subsequently backing away. As a result of his actions, Anthony was suspended for 15 games by NBA commissioner David Stern. Shortly thereafter, the Nuggets traded for Allen Iverson in a bid to form a deadly combination with Anthony. The duo did not get to play alongside one another until a home game against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 22, which was the day Anthony was allowed to return from his 15-game suspension. Anthony finished the game with 28 points, as he and Iverson combined for 51 points. On February 2, 2007, Anthony and teammate J. R. Smith were involved in a minor car accident. Neither player was injured in the collision. The only information released by the team was that the car Smith was driving belonged to Anthony. Three days later, Anthony recorded his first career triple-double, with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, in a 113–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns. When the reserves for the Western Conference All-Star team were announced, Anthony was not included on the roster. However, with Yao Ming and Carlos Boozer out with injuries, NBA commissioner David Stern chose Anthony as a replacement (along with Josh Howard). Anthony scored 20 points with nine rebounds in his All-Star debut. Anthony was the first Denver Nugget to be named an All-Star since Antonio McDyess in 2001. Anthony won Player of the Week honors three times during the season (November 20–26; November 27 – December 3; and February 5–11), and received Player of the Month honors for April, after leading the Nuggets to a 10–1 record for the month and into sixth place in the final regular season standings of the Western Conference. Anthony finished the season as the league's second leading scorer behind Bryant, with an average of 28.9 points, while adding 6.0 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He was named to All-NBA Third Team for the second straight year, along with Miami's Dwyane Wade, Detroit's Chauncy Billups, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and Orlando's Dwight Howard. For the second time in three years, Anthony and the sixth-seeded Nuggets faced the third-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the First Round of the playoffs. In a virtual repeat of the 2005 First Round playoff matchup between the two teams, Denver won the first game in San Antonio, 95–89, only to lose the next four games to the eventual NBA champions. The Nuggets were eliminated in the First Round for the fourth straight year. In the playoff series against the Spurs, Anthony averaged a team-high 26.8 points to go along with 8.6 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.0 steals per game. On January 24, 2008, Anthony was named to his second consecutive NBA All-Star Game—his first as a starter. He finished as the leading vote-getter among Western Conference forwards (1,723,701 votes) and second in overall voting to Kobe Bryant (2,004,940 votes) among all Western Conference players. On February 8, Anthony scored a then career-high 49 points in a 111–100 home win over the Washington Wizards. He had a field goal percentage of .760 on a 19-of-25 shooting effort, and his shooting percentage was the second highest in the last 13 years for a player who took 25 or more shots in a game (Bryant was first with a .769 field goal percentage on a 20-of-26 shooting effort, in a 99–94 road victory over the Houston Rockets on December 21, 2000). On March 27, in a home win over the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony scored his 9,000th career point. He played in 77 games during the regular season, finishing as the NBA's fourth-leading scorer with 25.7 points per game, and had career-highs in rebounds per game (7.4) and steals per game (1.3). He tied his career-high in blocks per game (0.5), and ended the season with 3.4 assists per game, which was the second-best mark of his career. The Nuggets finished the 2007–08 season with exactly 50 wins (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season. It was the first time since the 1987–88 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season. Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 Playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history. It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57–25 overall record) in the First Round of the Playoffs. The seven games separating the Nuggets overall record and the Lakers overall record is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983–84. The Lakers swept the Nuggets in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the First Round. For the series, Anthony averaged 22.5 points, 9.5 rebounds (playoff career-high), 2.0 assists and 0.5 steals per game. The 2008–09 campaign began with Allen Iverson being traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for guard Chauncey Billups. On December 10, 2008, in a 116–105 home win over the Timberwolves, Anthony tied George Gervin for the most points scored in one quarter in NBA history by scoring 33 points in the third quarter. Gervin had set the record when he was competing against David Thompson for the scoring title on the last day of the 1977–78 season. Anthony shot 12 of 15 (80%) in the third quarter and finished the game with 45 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, and four steals. The record was broken in January 2015 by Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors. On January 4, 2009, Anthony broke a bone in his hand in a game against the Indiana Pacers. He opted to have the hand splinted rather than have surgery; his recovery time was estimated at three to four weeks. He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow. Anthony returned from injury and to the Nuggets starting lineup on January 30, 2009, in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats in which he scored 19 points. Anthony was suspended for one game by the Nuggets for staying on the court and refusing to leave the game after coach George Karl benched him during a game against the Pacers. The Nuggets won the Northwest Division and placed second in the Western Conference, finishing the season with a franchise record-tying 54 wins (54–28 overall). Anthony averaged 22.8 points per game and made a career-high 37.1% of his shots from three-point range. After losing in five straight playoff appearances (2004–2008), on April 29, 2009, Anthony won his first playoff series when the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Hornets at home 107–86 where Anthony finished with a playoff career-high 34 points and four steals. In a post-game conference, Anthony said ""Yeah, finally... Took me 5 years to get that gorilla off my back, it's a great feeling."" The Nuggets beat the Hornets in five games in the First Round of the playoffs and proceeded to beat the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the Conference Semifinals with Anthony scoring 30 points in a solid game five performance. In the third game of the semifinals, Anthony made a last second three-point shot to give the Nuggets the win after being down by two points (103–105). Denver advanced to the Conference Finals for the first time since 1985 but was eliminated, 4–2, by the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on his birthday. In the opening two games of the 2009–10 season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers respectively. Anthony became one of three players in the Nuggets' history to open with 70 or more points through two games—tied with Nick Van Exel with 71 points—surpassed only by Alex English who did it twice, in 1985 (79) and 1988 (74). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0. In their third game, Anthony scored 42 points, a game after his 41-point explosion against the Blazers, becoming the first Nugget to have scored back-to-back 40-point games since Michael Adams did it in 1991. It was the first time they went 3–0 since 1985. In the month of November, Anthony was named the NBA player of the week and Western Conference Player of the Month, leading the Nuggets to a 12–5 start. In the fifteenth regular season game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony entered the game leading the league in points per game (30.2) and was the only player in the league to score at least 20 points in every game. He finished the game with 22 points which was his fifteenth consecutive game with at least 20 points breaking the previous franchise record of 14 straight sets by English. The following game, Anthony scored a career-high 50 points in a home game against the New York Knicks while teammate Chauncey Billups added 32 points in the game, making them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 50 and 30 points respectively. Two days later, Anthony scored 19 points in the first quarter—tying a season-high he made in the fourth quarter against the Portland Trail Blazers on October 29—in a home loss to the Timberwolves, 106–100, on the way to a total of 32 points. On January 21, 2010, Anthony was named as a starter for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game leading the Western Conference ballots in votes for forwards. This was Anthony's third All-Star appearance and second as a starter. He finished the game with a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds, in a losing effort as the team bowed to the Eastern Conference team. In the team's first game after the All-Star Game, the Nuggets visited the Cleveland Cavaliers in a highly anticipated game with the Cavaliers having a 13-game winning streak. While LeBron James posted a triple-double of 43 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists, Anthony compiled 40 points, six rebounds and seven assists in an overtime win as Anthony nailed a jumper over the outstretched arms of James with just 1.9 seconds left in the game, ending the Cavaliers' win streak. On March 26, 2010, Anthony made a game-winning shot at the buzzer, after missing his first attempt, against the Toronto Raptors. The Nuggets concluded the 2009–10 regular season with a 53–29 record and the Northwest Division title for the second straight season facing the Utah Jazz in the First Round. In Game 1, Anthony scored a playoff-career-high 42 points. This also matched a franchise-playoff high for scoring in a single playoff game, tied with Alex English. However, the Nuggets lost the series to the Utah Jazz 4–2, with Anthony averaging a playoff career-high 30.7 points per game, along with 8.5 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 steals. The 2010–11 season began with speculation that Anthony had requested a trade. Anthony refused to sign a proposed contract extension. Sources reported that Anthony's preferred destination was the New York Knicks, with other teams such as the New Jersey Nets, Houston Rockets and Atlanta Hawks said to be interested.[unreliable source?] Anthony's trade request was not initially fulfilled, and he began the season on the Nuggets' roster. On November 15, 2010, Anthony had 20 points and a career-high 22 rebounds for the first 20–20 game of his career against the Phoenix Suns. He also hit game-winning jumper at the buzzer against the Bulls on November 26, 2010. On February 22, 2011, Anthony, along with point guard Chauncey Billups, was traded to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Anthony chose to wear number 7 with the Knicks, as his former number 15 was retired by the Knicks in honor of Earl Monroe and Dick McGuire. Anthony's first game with the Knicks was a 114–108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in which he scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds and an assist. After Anthony's acquisition, the Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and were matched up against the Boston Celtics. During the series, the Knicks struggled with injuries as Amar'e Stoudemire and Billups went down. In game two of the NBA playoffs in Boston, Anthony tied a playoff career high with 42 points and also had 17 rebounds and six assists in a Knicks loss. The Knicks fell to the Boston Celtics in four games in the First Round of the playoffs. The 2011–12 season brought new expectations, as the season would be Anthony's first full season as a Knick. The Knicks struggled throughout the season, as injuries derailed the team. Anthony himself missed 11 games; during this stretch, the Knicks inserted Jeremy Lin as the team's starting point guard. This led to a historic stretch of games by Lin, and a period of basketball hysteria known as Linsanity. However, the team found themselves with an 18–24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D'Antoni. Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach's departure, as he was not a good fit in D'Antoni's high paced offense. Mike Woodson took over for D'Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony's play, as he was more suited for Woodson's halfcourt offense. On Easter Sunday, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three-pointers in a victory over Chicago. Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18–6, a vast improvement from the 18–24 record they had under D'Antoni. The Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and faced off against the eventual champions, the Miami Heat. During the series, the Knicks were hampered by injuries as they were a season before. Tyson Chandler was diagnosed with the flu for game 1, Iman Shumpert tore his ACL, Baron Davis tore his patella tendon, and All-Star Amar'e Stoudemire suffered a laceration on his hand after punching a fire extinguisher out of anger after a loss. In addition, Jeremy Lin had torn his left meniscus before the playoffs started. Despite the injuries, Anthony was able to lead the Knicks to their first playoff win since 2001. In the game, Anthony scored 41 points. The Knicks were eventually eliminated in five games, 4–1. Anthony was voted to the All-NBA Third Team alongside teammate Tyson Chandler. On December 3, 2012, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period November 26 to December 2, 2012. For the said period, Anthony led the Knicks to a 3–1 mark, averaging a league-best 29.5 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks. Anthony scored over 30 points in two contests. In New York's 106–99 home victory over the Phoenix Suns on Dec 2, Anthony scored a game-high 34 points and added six rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal. On January 7, 2013, Anthony received his second Player of the Week citation for games played from December 31, 2012, to January 6, 2013. During that time, he led the team to a 2–1 record, tallying a league-best 36.0 points per game. The week was highlighted by a pair of 40-point games, first in a loss to Portland (45 points, seven rebounds, four assists) on January 1, and then in a victory over Orlando (40 points, six rebounds and six assists) on January 5. On January 9, 2013, Anthony was suspended for one game without pay for confronting Kevin Garnett after a game on January 7. On January 30, 2013, in a game against the Orlando Magic, Anthony set the Knicks' team-record with 30 straight 20-point games, breaking the old record set by Richie Guerin (29 games). Anthony later extended the record to 31 games after he scored 25 points in a 96–86 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 29, 2013, Anthony recorded 32 points and 11 rebounds in a 111–102 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats. His teammate J. R. Smith scored 37 points in the game. On March 31, 2013, Anthony scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a win against the Boston Celtics as he recorded a double-double in consecutive games. With the victory, the Knicks won the season series against the Celtics (3–1) for the first time since the 2003–04 season. On April 2, 2013, Anthony tied his career high by scoring 50 points in a 102–90 win over the Miami Heat and became the first player in NBA history to record 50+ points with no baskets in the paint. He followed the next night with 40 points in a 95–82 victory over the Atlanta Hawks, and then 41 points against the Milwaukee Bucks two days later, becoming the first Knicks player since Bernard King to score 40+ points in three consecutive games. He also became only the third NBA player to score at least 40 points on at least 60% field-goal shooting in three consecutive games, joining King and Michael Jordan. On April 7, 2013, Anthony scored 36 points and 12 rebounds, nine offensive, as the Knicks tallied their 12th straight win in a 125–120 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was the team's 50th win of the season, and it marked the first time they posted that many wins in 13 years. By scoring 36 points to Kevin Durant's 27 points, he overtook the latter in the scoring race, upping his season average to 28.44 to Durant's 28.35 points per game. On April 8, 2013, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period April 1–7, 2013. He led the Knicks to a 4–0 record as part of their 12-game winning streak, during which he averaged 41.8 points per game. On April 9, 2013, Anthony kept up his torrid pace as he once again scored 36 points on a 13-of-21 shooting (3–4 from the three-point line) as he became the first Knick since King to post five consecutive games of at least 35 points in a 120–99 victory over the Washington Wizards. It was also the team's 51st win, and 13th straight win and they clinched their first Atlantic Division title since the 1993–94 season. No NBA player had scored at least 35 points in five straight games since Kobe Bryant in the 2006–07 season. In 2013, Anthony became the first Knicks player with the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, based on sales at the NBA Store and NBAstore.com, since the league started tracking jersey sales in 2001. On April 11, 2013, the Knicks' 13-game winning streak ended with a loss to the Bulls, 118–111. Despite the loss, Anthony scored 36 points on top of a season-high 19 rebounds, and he set a franchise record with six straight games with at least 35 points. The following day, the Knicks bounced back with an easy 101–91 victory over the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers. Anthony again led the way with another double-double game of 31 points and 14 rebounds in just under 30 minutes, as he sat out the entire fourth quarter for the second time in three games. On April 15, 2013, Anthony won his second straight Eastern Conference Player of the Week award for games played from April 8 to 15, 2013, when he led the team to a 3–1 record. For the week, he averaged a conference-best 32.0 points and a seventh-best 11.5 rebounds per game. He became the 2013 NBA scoring champion with 28.7 points per game after second place scorer and three-time reigning scoring champion Kevin Durant decided to sit out his last regular season game against the Milwaukee Bucks, ending his season with an average of 28.1 points per game. At the close of the regular season, Anthony was named as the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April. Anthony broke LeBron James' stranglehold on the monthly award after James had received such honors five times that season. In the 2013 NBA Playoffs, Anthony scored 21 points to go with seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block in the Knicks' series-clinching 88–80 game six victory against the Boston Celtics, in their First Round playoff series. It was the Knicks' first playoff series win since 2000 (during the time of Patrick Ewing and Latrell Sprewell). Anthony averaged a team-high 29.2 points per game in the series. This was the second highest playoff series average of a Knick player against the Celtics, behind Ewing's 31.6 during their 1989–90 First Round series. In the next round, the Knicks were defeated by the Indiana Pacers in six games. On May 23, 2013, Anthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team, alongside Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook, San Antonio's Tony Parker, the LA Clippers' Blake Griffin and Memphis' Marc Gasol. It was the second time in Anthony's career that he made the Second Team. Early in the 2013–14 NBA season, the Knicks suffered a nine-game losing streak, as the team opened with a 3–13 record. Despite the losing record, Anthony continued to play well under the circumstances, averaging 26.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game, nine double-doubles including four straight: against Indiana (30 points and 18 rebounds), Washington (23 and 12), Portland (34 and 15) and LA Clippers (27 and 10). However, at the start of 2014, the Knicks went 4–1, including big wins against previous season finalists Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs. In the victory against the Heat, Anthony and James ended up in a virtual deadlock as the former registered 29 points (shooting 12-of-24), eight rebounds, five assists and two steals as against the latter's 32 points (shooting 12-of-17), five rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block. On January 13, 2014, Anthony was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played January 6–12, 2014 where he led the Knicks to a 3–0 record. He beat out Brooklyn's Joe Johnson and Detroit's Josh Smith for the honor. On January 24, he established his career high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring with a 62-point, 13-rebound, 0 turnover effort against the Charlotte Bobcats. On January 30, 2014, in a 117–86 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Anthony became the 50th NBA player to score 19,000 career points. In doing so at the age of 29 years and 246 days old, Anthony became the fifth-youngest NBA player to achieve the feat, only beaten by LeBron James (27 years and 111 days), Kobe Bryant (28 and 223), Michael Jordan (29 and 62) and Wilt Chamberlain (29 and 75). On February 5, 2014, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the month of January. Anthony led the Eastern Conference in scoring with a 28.7 points, ninth in rebounding with 9.0 rebounds and third in minutes played with a 37.7 minutes per game, while leading the Knicks to a 10–6 record highlighted by his 62-point game effort against Charlotte. On February 16, 2014, Anthony played in his seventh All-Star Game as a starter for the East All-Stars. He scored 30 points and set an NBA All-Star game record of eight made three-pointers, breaking the old mark of six jointly shared by Mark Price and LeBron James. On March 10, 2014, Anthony won his second Eastern Conference Player of the Week citation for games played March 3–9, 2014. During the week, Anthony led the Knicks to a 3–1 record with averages of 29.0 points (third-best in the Eastern Conference), 5.3 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 2.75 steals (fifth-best) per game, while playing a conference fourth-best 38.7 minutes per game. For the 2013–14 season, Anthony averaged 27.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in a league-leading 38.7 minutes per game, but would miss the NBA playoffs for the first time in his career. On June 23, 2014, Anthony informed the Knicks that he would opt out of his contact and become a free agent. On July 13, 2014, Anthony re-signed with the Knicks to a reported five-year deal. In just the team's third game in the season, Anthony became the 40th member of the exclusive 20,000 points club, when he hit a three-pointer early in the first quarter of a 96–93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. He eventually finished with 28 points, hiking his total to 20,025 career points. In the process, he became the 10th active player to achieve the milestone and the sixth youngest in NBA history to reach the milestone just behind LeBron James (28 years, 17 days), Kobe Bryant (29 years, 122 days), Wilt Chamberlain (29 years, 134 days), Michael Jordan (29 years, 326 days) and Oscar Robertson (30 years, 97 days). Anthony accomplished this at the age of 30 years and 157 days and in a total of 793 NBA games, tied for 15th all-time in number of games needed to score at least 20,000 points. On January 22, 2015, Anthony was named as a starter in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, his seventh consecutive start and eight overall alongside LeBron James, Pau Gasol, Kyle Lowry and John Wall. After competing in the All-Star game and scoring 10 points, Anthony was ruled out for the rest of the season on February 18, after undergoing left knee surgery. On January 20, 2016, in the Knicks' 118–111 overtime win against the Jazz, Anthony recorded 30 points, seven rebounds and nine assists, while passing Larry Bird for 31st place in career points scored. On January 21, Anthony was voted as starter for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game. In the All-Star game Anthony recorded 11 points, 6 rebounds and 1 block in the East's 196–173 loss to the West. On January 23, Anthony moved past Gary Payton as the league's 30th all-time career scoring leader in a 97–84 loss to the Charlotte Hornets On December 9, 2016, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, Anthony became the fifth active player to eclipse the 23,000 point mark joining Dirk Nowitzki, James, Paul Pierce and Vince Carter in the prestigious club. He also became the 29th player in NBA history to hit the scoring milestone. On December 25, 2016, in a Christmas Day game against the Boston Celtics, Anthony moved past Elgin Baylor into 28th place on the NBA career scoring list when he scored 29 points upping his total to 23,156 compared to Baylor's 23,149. On December 30, 2016, Anthony scored 26 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in a 92–104 loss, upping his total to 23,192 points, moving past Adrian Dantley into 27th place in the NBA career scoring list.

He also had the fifth-most points among active players after Nowitzki, James, Pierce, and Carter, who was No. 24 in the scoring list. It was the 12th time Anthony has scored at least 17 points in his last 13 games that included his season-high of 45 points in a quadruple-OT loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On February 15, 2017, he was announced as the replacement for Kevin Love on the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, thus gaining his tenth All-Star appearance. Anthony played 19 minutes, scored 10 points on a 4-of-8 shooting including 2–6 on three-pointers and grabbed three rebounds in the All-Star Game. On March 12, 2017, in a 120–112 loss to Knicks cross-town rivals Brooklyn Nets, Anthony became only the third player to score 10,000 points for two franchises, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Milwaukee Bucks and L.A. Lakers) and Elvin Hayes (San Diego/Houston Rockets and Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets). He began his career with the Denver Nuggets, where he scored a total of 13,970 points in 564 games. Two days later, on March 14, in an 87–81 victory over the Indiana Pacers, ending a three-game losing streak, Anthony surpassed the 24,000 career point mark by scoring 22 points with 13 rebounds. During the 2017 off-season, after multiple conflicts with the then-team president Phil Jackson, Anthony demanded a trade. Originally, the only team for which Anthony was willing to waive his no-trade clause was the Houston Rockets. However, Anthony expanded his list of teams to include the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder. On September 25, 2017, Anthony was traded to the Thunder in exchange for Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick. During Anthony's seven seasons with the Knicks, the team won one playoff series. On November 9, 2017, with only 12 points needed to move up in the rankings, Anthony passed Allen Iverson on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to the 24th spot. He finished the game with 28 points. On November 26, 2017, Anthony passed Ray Allen on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to 23rd place. On December 11, 2017, Anthony passed Vince Carter for 22nd on the NBA all-time scoring list.

On January 27, 2018, Anthony became the 21st NBA player to score 25,000 career points. In addition, he has 1,693 playoff points. On March 6, 2018, in Oklahoma City's game against the Houston Rockets, Anthony scored 23 points to move past NBA legend Jerry West into the Top 20 in the NBA career scoring list as he now has a total of 25,210 as compared to West's 25,192 total points.

On July 25, 2018, the Thunder traded Anthony to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade in which they acquired Dennis Schröder from the Hawks and Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot from the Philadelphia 76ers. The trade was widely seen as a cost-cutting move, as it saved the Thunder tens of millions of dollars in luxury tax payments. On July 30, Anthony accepted a contract buyout from the Hawks, and was subsequently placed on waivers. On August 13, 2018, Anthony signed a one-year, $2.4 million veterans minimum contract with the Houston Rockets coached by his former Knicks coach, Mike D'Antoni. On November 15, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey announced that the team was ""parting ways"" with Anthony, but had not released him. He played ten games for Houston, starting twice, but he was held out of the last three for what the club called an unspecified ""illness."" During that absence, much of his playing time went to rookie Gary Clark. Houston had started the season losing seven of their first 11 games. Morey said that Anthony ""accepted every role"" asked by D'Antoni, but that the ""fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized; therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him."" D'Antoni stated that he ""didn't ever want to disrespect [Anthony] and his career. He's going in the Hall of Fame."" On January 22, 2019, the Rockets traded Anthony, the draft rights to Jon Diebler, and undisclosed cash considerations to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tadija Dragićević. This trade allowed the Rockets to alleviate luxury-tax penalties up to $2.6 million. On February 1, he was waived by the Bulls. On November 19, 2019, Anthony was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers to a one-year, non-guaranteed deal. With his last NBA game having been on November 8, 2018, Anthony made his debut as a Blazer in a 115–104 road loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on November 19; he started and had 10 points to go along with 4 rebounds and 1 block in 24 minutes of play. On November 25, Anthony scored a season-high 25 points along with 8 rebounds in a 117–94 road victory over the Chicago Bulls. In the same game, Anthony moved past Alex English into 18th spot on the NBA's all-time scoring list. A couple of days later Anthony was named Western Conference Player of the Week when he led the Trail Blazers to a 3–0 record with averages of 22.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. On December 6, Anthony's contract became fully guaranteed. On January 1, 2020, Anthony bested his season-high by scoring 26 points in a 117–93 loss to the New York Knicks. On January 7, Anthony recorded a new season-high 28 points and seven rebounds, and hit the game-winning shot in a 101–99 win over the Toronto Raptors. On January 15, Anthony recorded his third double-double of the season with 18 points and a season-high 12 rebounds in Portland's 117–107 victory over the Rockets. On January 17, Anthony scored 22 points in a 120–112 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, while becoming the 18th player in NBA history to reach the 26,000 points mark.

He averaged 2.4 points, 1.6 rebounds and 6.8 minutes of playing time while playing in seven of the team's eight games.

Anthony also added 5.2 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 0.7 steals and 0.3 blocks per game. He equaled the previous record of 28 points set by Allen Iverson in a qualifying tournament, which was later broken by James, who scored 31 points in the title-clinching win against Argentina.

In the gold medal game, the United States defeated 2006 World Champion Spain, with Anthony scoring 13 points. Anthony posted averages of 11.5 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 steals per game in eight contests. Anthony, along with LeBron James, also participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London. It was his third straight Olympiad (2004, 2008, 2012), as he joined James and David Robinson (1988, 1992, 1996) as the only American basketball players to play in three Olympiads. Anthony played in all eight games, serving as Team USA's sixth man. He posted averages of 16.3 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 0.5 steals per game, built around 50% shooting from three-point range (23–46), 53% field-goal shooting (46–86) and 79% free throws (15–19). In a 156–73 victory over Nigeria, Anthony connected on 10–12 three-point attempts, both US Olympic records for made and attempted shots, on the way to 37 points, another Team USA record (breaking the 31 of Stephon Marbury set in the 2004 edition). Team USA won the gold medal as they defended their 2008 title against Spain, winning 107–100. Anthony's 16.3 points per game average were the second best for Team USA behind Kevin Durant's record-setting 19.5 points per game. Anthony's 23 made three-point shots were second-best to Durant's record 34 as they both broke the previous Team USA record of 17 made three-point shots. Anthony also played in the 2016 Olympic Games, his fourth straight stint in the Olympics, which was a record for a US male basketball player, breaking the old record of having played in three Olympiads he shared with James and Robinson. Team USA won the gold medal when they beat Serbia, 96–66, in the championship game with Anthony becoming the first player in US men's basketball history to win three gold medals. During the team's 98–88 victory over Australia, Anthony scored a game-high 31 points in 35 minutes built around 11–21 field goal shooting, including 9–15 from three-point range.

He also became the first US player to score 30 or more points in two Olympic Games. In the gold medal game against Serbia, Anthony collared seven rebounds to finish with 125 total rebounds in US Olympic history, passing Robinson as Team USA's all-time leader in most rebounds.

In recognition of his performances and accomplishments in the tournament, Anthony was named co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year (along with Kevin Durant) for the third time in his career. Anthony plays the small forward position, but he is also capable of playing power forward. His scoring prowess is considered his best asset with his ability to take over any game on the offensive end; he shares the NBA record for second most points scored in one quarter with 33, and holds the New York Knicks single-game franchise scoring record with 62. On offense, Anthony is recognized for being a prolific scorer with a variety of crafty offensive moves. Listed at 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) and 235 pounds (107 kg), he has strength and quickness to be an immediate and consistent scoring threat in the post. He also likes creating space from his defenders which allows him to step into his jump shot or put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket and get to the free throw line. Anthony is often known for being one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005–06 season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime.Dave McMenamin, a staff writer for ESPN, wrote, ""If you were going to choose one player to challenge Bryant for his title of Mr. Clutch, it would have to be Anthony."" Despite being a prolific scorer, he has been criticized for his defense and has never been named to the NBA All-Defensive Team. Anthony is one of many NBA players who use Idan Ravin as a personal coach and trainer. His relationship with Ravin started when he was 18 years old and preparing for the NBA draft after spending his one year at Syracuse University. Anthony has two brothers, Robert and Wilford, and a half-sister, Daphne. He had another sister, Michelle, who died in 2010. His mother, Mary, is African American and his father, Carmelo Iriarte, was Puerto Rican. In 2004, Anthony became engaged to Alani ""La La"" Vazquez. Their son, Kiyan Carmelo Anthony, was born on March 7, 2007. Michael Eric Dyson married Anthony and La La on July 10, 2010, at Cipriani's in New York City before 320 guests. VH1 filmed the ceremony for use in a reality series on the couple, titled La La's Full Court Wedding. Anthony resides on the Upper West Side.

Charges were later dropped after Anthony's friend, James Cunningham, of St. Louis, signed an affidavit taking responsibility for the marijuana. That same year, Anthony appeared in a video entitled Stop Snitchin', which warned that residents of Baltimore who collaborated with the police would face violence. Anthony later distanced himself from this video. In 2006, Anthony's friend, Tyler Brandon Smith, was pulled over in Anthony's vehicle and cited for marijuana possession and three traffic violations. Later that year, he was involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl during a game at Madison Square Garden. He was suspended for 15 games as a result. On April 14, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, after being pulled over on Interstate 25 in Denver for weaving through lanes and not dimming his lights. Police spokesperson Detective Sharon Hahn said Anthony, who was alone in the car, failed a series of sobriety tests. He was ticketed and then released at police headquarters to a ""sober, responsible party."" A court date was set for May 14. The Nuggets suspended Anthony for two games due to the arrest. On June 24, 2008, Anthony pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while ability-impaired. The original charge of driving while under the influence was dropped. He was sentenced to one year of probation, 24 hours of community service and US$1,000 in court costs and fines. Anthony has recently advocated various social justice causes. He is also being criticized by South Bronx community activists for aligning himself with Mott Haven developer Keith Rubenstein's efforts to build luxury apartment buildings in the neighborhood, which could lead to gentrification. In Denver, Anthony was a spokesman for the Family Resource Center and helped organize a Christmas party, entitled ""A Very Melo Christmas,"" for less well-off children. In Baltimore, Anthony hosts an annual 3-on-3 tournament, known as ""Melo's H.O.O.D. (Holding Our Own Destiny) Movement 3 on 3 Challenge"" and is helping fund the revitalization of a local community center for local youth. Anthony opened ""The Carmelo Anthony Youth Development Center"" in Baltimore on December 14, 2006. He contributed $1.5 million to the Living Classrooms Foundation, a non-profit organization that ""provides innovative hands-on-education, job-training, and community service programs for over 35,000 children, youth and young adults in the east Baltimore community."" After the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Anthony donated $35,000 to relief efforts. He donated $1,000 per point scored against San Antonio and Houston on January 8 and 9, 2005, respectively.Anthony also committed $3 million toward the construction of a newly planned basketball practice facility at his alma mater, Syracuse University. According to the NBA's official website, ""Anthony's gift represents one of the largest individual donations to Syracuse University Athletics and is also believed to be one of largest by a current professional athlete to the school they attended."" The practice facility will be called the Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center. For charitable contributions totaling $4,282,000, Anthony was listed as number eight in ""The Giving Back 30 List of Largest Charitable Donations by Celebrities in 2006"".

In spring 2012, Anthony guest starred in several episodes of the Showtime series Nurse Jackie as a professional baseball player going through drug rehab. He, along with Dwight Howard and Scottie Pippen, also appeared in the 2013 Chinese film Amazing, a joint venture between the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation. In 2003, Anthony signed his first shoe deal with Jordan brand and was paid $3.5 million per year for six years. In 2004, his first signature shoe, the Jordan Carmelo 1.5, was released. As of 2018, thirteen shoes have been released in the Melo line.

In 2015, Anthony founded North American Soccer League expansion club Puerto Rico FC. Despite the financial recession in Puerto Rico, Anthony saw this opportunity as a form of community outreach, as well as a long-term investment in a club that could ultimately be profitable. Anthony is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.",26085,115,2019-20,40.0,40.0,1299.0,6.4,15.4,0.414,1.5,4.4,0.35,4.8,11.1,0.439,2.4,2.9,0.837,1.4,5.9,7.3,1.7,0.9,0.5,1.9,3.3,16.7,25.0,Portland Trail Blazers

He played for the Arizona Wildcats in the Pac-12 Conference in the 2017–18 season and was a consensus five-star prospect in the Class of 2017, as well as a McDonald's All-American.Ayton was selected with the first overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft by the Suns. He was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2018–19 NBA season. Ayton was born in Nassau, Bahamas to Bahamian father Alvin and Jamaican mother Andrea.Ayton was first scouted by an Annual Bahamian basketball magazine called the Bahamian Basketball Yearbook.At the age of 12, Ayton was scouted by the All Bahamian Brand who were visiting Bahamas Academy High School, a tiny private school then located on Wulff Road in Nassau. The scouts came when Ayton, a tuba and soccer player, was at band practice, rather than basketball practice, but were impressed by his 6'5"" frame. Ayton moved to San Diego, California to play high school basketball. Ayton attended Balboa City School in San Diego, California and started on the varsity basketball team for two years. As a sophomore in 2014–15, Ayton led Balboa to a 17-14 record, averaging 21 points, 16 rebounds and 3.8 blocks per game. He racked up double-doubles in 21 of 22 regular season games. That summer, he averaged 16.5 points, 13.5 rebounds and 2.2 blocks a game for Supreme Court AAU (California) on the Under Armour circuit.As a standout in his class, he elected to transfer from Balboa City School to explore an opportunity at a Prep Academy. Ayton, now a junior in 2015–16, transferred to Hillcrest Prep Academy in Phoenix, Arizona to play out his last two years.During this high school year, he became teammates with another top-tier Class of 2017 player in 2018's #2 pick Marvin Bagley III. Throughout his junior year, Ayton averaged 29.2 points, 16.7 rebounds, 3.8 blocks per game. As a senior in 2016–17, Ayton led Hillcrest to a 33-6 record and national rankings across multiple outlets while averaging 26 points, 15 rebounds and 3.5 blocks. While representing the World Select team, Ayton played at the 2016 Nike Hoop Summit, chipping in with eight points to go along with seven rebounds.Ayton was considered one of the top prospects in the 2017 recruiting class by Scout.com, Rivals.com and ESPN. Ayton was rated as a five-star recruit and the No.3 overall recruit and No.1 center in the 2017 high school class. In 2015, he was ranked by Scout as the top prospect in all of high school in their ""Ultimate 100"" list. He had narrowed his choices between three schools: Arizona, Kansas and Kentucky. On September 6, 2016, Ayton committed to play for the Arizona Wildcats, and he signed his letter of intent. Ayton made his debut with the University of Arizona on November 10, 2017, recording 19 points, 12 rebounds, and 3 blocks in a 101–67 win over the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks. His 19 points was 7th most for a Freshman in an Arizona debut. Throughout his college career, he was used as a power forward instead of center; Dušan Ristić was Arizona's starting center instead. On December 9, 2017, Ayton recorded what was, at the time, a season-high 29 points and 18 rebounds in an 88–82 win over the Alabama Crimson Tide. On December 30, 2017, against the in-state rival Arizona State Sun Devils, he recorded 19 rebounds, which would be a season-high at the time. On January 20, 2018, against Stanford, he blocked 6 shots, which tied him for most in Arizona Freshman single game history. He had also recorded 17 20-point games and 23 double-doubles through 34 games. However, while Ayton had some great successes during his freshman season, there were also controversies mired during his last few months there. On February 23, 2018, a reported FBI wiretap revealed Arizona's head coach, Sean Miller, allegedly talked with Christian Dawkins (a key figure involved in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal) to discuss paying Ayton $100,000 to allow him to enter the university, with the monetary situation being dealt with directly to him. While Miller would not be coaching the next game a day later against Oregon (assistant coach Lorenzo Romar would replace Miller that night), Ayton would still be allowed to play that day as the starting center. In that game, Ayton would record 28 points, 18 rebounds, and 4 blocks in the overtime loss to Oregon. The wiretapped conversation reportedly occurred in 2016, when Ayton was still attending the Hillcrest Prep Academy. Later on October 11, 2018, a government official revealed a now-former Adidas consultant named T.J. Gassnola paid a currently unknown amount of money to Ayton's family via Christian Dawkins in order to attend some Adidas sponsored programs. On May 2, 2019, federal prosecutors played a wiretapped call from June 20, 2017 between Dawkins and former assistant coach Emanuel Richardson that Miller was paying Ayton $10,000 per month while enrolled at Arizona. On March 3, 2018, after their last regular season home game against California, where he'd record 26 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in a 66–54 win over California, head coach Sean Miller honored Ayton, as well as underclassmen Rawle Alkins and Allonzo Trier, with confirmations that they'd all be entering the 2018 NBA Draft at the end of this season. On March 9, Ayton would record a career-high 32 points with 14 rebounds in a 78–67 overtime win against UCLA. He'd tie that career-high for points the next day alongside grabbing 18 rebounds in the Pac-12 Championship game against USC, where the Wildcats won 75–61. Ayton would be named the Pac-12 Tournament's Most Outstanding Player during the event. At the end of the regular season, Ayton was named both the Pac-12's Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year, as well as become a member of the All-Pac-12 first team (in terms of both regular voting and voting through the Associated Press) and be named the winner of the Karl Malone Award. He was also voted a consensus first-team All-American. Furthermore, Ayton was one of three freshman to be a part of the All-American First Team, joining Marvin Bagley III and Trae Young for the most consensus freshmen First Team members in a season. Following Arizona's upset loss to the University at Buffalo in the Round of 64 of the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, Ayton announced his intention to forgo his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility and declare for the 2018 NBA draft, where he was expected to be a top-tier lottery selection, if not the potential #1 draft pick. On April 26, 2018, Ayton announced he signed with agent Nima Namakian of BDA Sports. On June 21, 2018, the Phoenix Suns selected Ayton with the first overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft. He was the franchise's first No. 1 pick in their history. Never before had the player picked with the first overall selection gone to a team from the state where he played in high school and college before entering the NBA. Ayton joined the 2018 NBA Summer League Suns squad on July 1, 2018, signing his rookie-scale contract five days later. In his Summer League debut on July 6, Ayton recorded 10 points and 8 rebounds in a 92–85 win over the Dallas Mavericks. At the end of the event, Ayton averaged a double-double of 14.5 points and 10.5 rebounds in four games played and named a member of the All-Summer League Second Team. He also averaged 18.2 points, 9.8 rebounds, 2 blocks, 1.4 assists, and 0.8 steals per game in five games during the 2018 preseason with the Suns.

Five days later, Ayton recorded a double-double of 20 points and 14 rebounds (alongside 5 assists) in a 123–103 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On October 27, he recorded 24 points on near-perfect shooting (12/13 shots made) alongside 5 assists in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.

Six days later, Ayton recorded a double-double of 17 points and a season-high 18 rebounds in a 107–98 loss to the Toronto Raptors. Ayton later recorded a new career-high of 33 points, alongside 14 rebounds, in a 122–118 loss to the Denver Nuggets on December 29.

However, Ayton sprained his left ankle three days later against the Memphis Grizzlies, ending his rookie season early. He became the third rookie in a decade to average a double-double in their rookie season, joining Blake Griffin and Karl-Anthony Towns. At the conclusion of the season, Ayton was named as one of three finalists for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in the 2019 NBA Awards show. On May 21, Ayton was selected to the 2019 All-Rookie First Team. On October 24, 2019, after the 2019–20 season opener, Ayton was suspended for 25 games after testing positive for a diuretic, violating the league's anti-drug policy. He returned from his suspension on December 17 against the Los Angeles Clippers, putting up 18 points and 12 rebounds in a 120–99 loss. Ayton was later immediately sidelined for the next five games due to a sprained right ankle before returning again, this time coming off the bench, on December 30 in a 122–116 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He returned as a starter proper, albeit as a power forward, on January 3, 2020 in a 120–112 win over the New York Knicks. After a few more games, Ayton became the team's starting center again on January 16. That night, he scored 26 points and grabbed a career-high 21 rebounds in a 121–98 win over the Knicks. He became the first Suns player since Steve Nash to put up a 20/20 kind of game for the team (first player since Amar'e Stoudemire in terms of points and rebounds specifically), as well as the youngest player to have 25+ points and 20+ rebounds in the Madison Square Garden. On January 28, Ayton scored a season-high 31 points in a 133–104 win over the Dallas Mavericks. Two days later, Ayton was announced to return to the Rising Stars Challenge for the World Team; he joins only Amar'e Stoudemire and Devin Booker as announced participants in the event for the Suns as both a rookie and sophomore. On February 8, Ayton scored 28 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in a loss to the Denver Nuggets. He became the quickest player in franchise history to reach 1,000 rebounds at 94 games, as well as the fourth-quickest player to reach 1,000 since 1992. Ayton is known for being a physically demanding center at 7'1"", with a weight of 250 pounds being reported during his rookie season with Phoenix. His wingspan has been projected to be at 7'5"", while his vertical leap is slated to be at 43.5"". He sees his game as something akin to Hakeem Olajuwon's (primarily with his footwork, which allows him to keep up with smaller players) with the competitive mentality of Kevin Garnett. ESPN analyst Jay Williams compared him to David Robinson and Anthony Davis. Ayton represented The Bahamas in the 2016 Centrobasket, the regional basketball championship of FIBA Americas for the Central American and Caribbean subzone where he averaged a tournament-leading 11.1 rebounds per game. In June 2018, it was announced he would be sponsored by Puma after the German company announced that they would be returning to the basketball market. In the days after Hurricane Dorian struck the Bahamas, Ayton donated $100,000 to various relief efforts and held a relief drive on September 10, 2019 to collect further supplies and donations to give to those affected by the hurricane.",26092,165,2019-20,23.0,18.0,760.0,9.1,17.0,0.539,0.0,0.1,0.0,9.1,16.9,0.542,2.1,2.7,0.804,4.3,8.8,13.1,2.4,0.8,1.8,2.1,3.4,20.4,24.0,Phoenix Suns

As a freshman in 2016–17, he was one of 50 players named to the preseason watch list for the John R. Wooden Award, given annually to the top college player in the nation. Ball's vision and passing skills led UCLA's rise up the national rankings, as he and fellow freshman T. J. Leaf helped the Bruins bounce back from a 15–17 record from the year before. Ball led the nation in assists and transformed the Bruins into the top scoring offense in the country. In his first collegiate game against Pacific, he had 19 points, 11 assists, and eight rebounds. Later in the year, Ball was named the MVP of the Wooden Legacy tournament, after he led UCLA to a win over Texas A&M in the championship game. He remained on the Wooden Award list in midseason, when he was also joined by Leaf, as UCLA was one of just five schools with two candidates on the list. In a 107–66 blowout win against the Washington Huskies, Ball had 22 points, six rebounds, and five assists. With close to two dozen NBA executives in attendance, the game matched Ball against the Huskies' Markelle Fultz, who were among the nation's top point guards and projected to be among the top picks in the 2017 NBA draft.

For the season, Ball averaged 14.6 points, 7.6 assists, and 6.0 rebounds. He was the only player in the nation to average at least 14 points, six assists, and six rebounds, and was the first player in the conference since California's Jason Kidd in 1993–94 to average at least 14 points, seven assists, and six rebounds.

He and Brandon Ingram, their second overall pick from the previous year, headlined a young core for the Lakers. D'Angelo Russell, their No. 2 pick in 2015, was traded days earlier, partly to clear the way for their newly drafted point guard. Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson billed Ball as ""the new face of the Lakers."" During the 2017 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, Ball was named the league MVP after averaging 16.3 points, 9.3 assists, 7.7 rebounds, 2.5 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game. He had two triple-doubles, the first in Vegas since 2008 and the first ever in Vegas by a rookie. He had four games with 10 or more assists, becoming the first in league history to have more than 10 assists in more than one game; his 9.3 assist average was also a league record. As a rookie in 2017–18, Ball played in 52 games, missing 30 games due to shoulder and knee injuries. In the second game of the season on October 20, 2017, he scored a career-high 29 points, to go along with 11 rebounds and 9 assists in a 132–130 win against the Phoenix Suns, falling one assist shy of becoming the youngest player to notch a triple double in NBA history. In the following contest, he had eight points, eight rebounds, and 13 assists in a 119–112 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, becoming the youngest player in franchise history to get at least 10 assists in a game. On November 11, he recorded 19 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds in a 98–90 loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the youngest player at the time to achieve a triple-double at the age of 20 years and 15 days old, breaking James's record by five days. Leading up to the game, Bucks' coach Jason Kidd, who Ball is often compared to, had called it ""a stretch"" to compare the two since it was too early in Ball's career. Ball, who had been struggling with his shooting, made over 50% of his field goals in a game for the first time in his career. On November 19, he recorded his second triple-double with 11 points, 16 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 127–109 win over the Denver Nuggets. It was the most rebounds by an NBA rookie guard since Steve Francis had 17 in 1999–2000. He also joined fellow NBA rookie Ben Simmons, as well as Magic Johnson, Connie Hawkins, Art Williams, and Oscar Robertson as the only players to record multiple triple-doubles within the first 20 games of their NBA careers. Ball missed the team's Christmas game after spraining his left shoulder in the previous contest against the Portland Trail Blazers. His shooting had improved to 34.9 percent from the field and 29.7 percent on three-pointers after having made 44 percent of his field goals and 44.2 percent of his three-pointers in the seven games prior to the injury. He returned after missing six games, playing in five games before spraining the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee against the Dallas Mavericks on January 13, 2018. Originally, he was expected to be sidelined for one to three weeks. Ball was selected to play in the Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star Weekend, but withdrew because of the injury. He returned after the All-Star break after missing 15 games. On February 23, he played 17 minutes and had nine points, seven rebounds and six assists in a 124–102 victory against the Mavericks. It was the first game he played all season that he did not start. He was also on a minutes restriction, and the Lakers held him out of their following contest to limit his back-to-back games during his return. Ball missed the final eight games of the season due to a knee contusion. He ended the season with averages of 10.2 points, 7.2 assists and 6.9 rebounds, but made only 36 percent of his field goals. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team, while fellow rookie teammate Kyle Kuzma exceeded expectations and earned first-team honors. On July 17, 2018, Ball underwent an arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to repair a torn meniscus. The surgery limited him from working on his game; however, he increased his strength, particularly in his upper body, amidst the Lakers front office challenge for him to improve his durability. Ball set a goal to play all 82 games as a sophomore in 2018–19. During the offseason, the Lakers signed the four-time NBA Most Valuable Player James, which shifted the spotlight away from Ball. They also signed veteran point guard Rajon Rondo to mentor and compete with the youngster. A week before camp, Lakers coach Luke Walton stated that Ball would be eased back and not participate in full-contact practices initially. Ball's added bulk made him better on defense,and he became one of the Lakers' most dynamic defenders during the season as he picked up point guards full-court to create turnovers in the backcourt. On offense, he had to adjust to playing off the ball more with James often handling the ball. On December 15, in a 128–100 win against the Charlotte Hornets, the duo became the first teammates to achieve a triple-double in the same game since Jason Kidd and Vince Carter did it in 2007, with Ball posting 16 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, while James had 24 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists. The last Lakers' teammates to accomplish the feat were Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1982. It was Ball's third triple-double of his career and his first in over a year. On January 19, 2019, he had a career-high seven assists in a quarter to help the Lakers build a 13-point lead over Houston after the first period. In the third quarter, he collided with the Rockets' James Ennis III and suffered a Grade 3 left ankle sprain, which included a torn ligament. Ball left the contest with 11 assists in 22 minutes and the team up by 18 points, but the Lakers lost the game in overtime 138–134. He had suffered two other ankle injuries earlier in the season, but had been able to play in all of the team's first 47 games. Ball had been playing some of the best basketball of his career at that point. Since Walton called him out for being passive after a 108–86 loss against Minnesota, he had been averaging 13 points, 6.4 rebounds and 8.4 assists with nearly two steals over seven games before the injury. Ball was selected again for the Rising Stars game, but he was ruled out again because of his ankle injury. In late February, he traveled to Ohio to potentially undergo surgery that had not been authorized by the Lakers, before the team informed him that his contract could be voided if he proceeded, and successfully talked him out of it. Originally expected to be sidelined for four to six weeks, he was shut down for the rest of the season in March. On July 6, 2019, the Lakers traded Ball, Ingram, Josh Hart, the draft rights to De'Andre Hunter, two first round picks, a first-round pick swap and cash to New Orleans for All-Star Anthony Davis. Ball used to have an unorthodox jump shot whereby he moves the ball from his left hip to the left of his forehead. He rotates his right elbow in toward his chest until it reaches a 45-degree angle, when he shoots the ball towards the basket. He prefers to shoot jumpers while moving towards his left. During the off-season of the 2019–20 NBA season, videos of Ball's new shooting form emerged. He is now shooting into a more conventional form with the ball squared up to his forehead. Ball began shooting in games from 40 feet (12 m) deep since he was a pre-teen. In college, he shot three-pointers from beyond the NBA line, which is 4 feet (1.2 m) longer than the 19-foot-9-inch (6.02 m) college line. His go-to shot with time expiring was a step-back 3-pointer from deep. Though praised for his defensive instincts and effort Ball has been criticized for being injury prone, missing already 40% of the games in his young NBA career. Ball began his pro career using sports apparel from his father LaVar's Big Baller Brand instead of signing with any of the major apparel companies. His father had insisted that he not sign with a company unless they agreed to license merchandise from Big Baller Brand. In May 2017, Big Baller Brand announced the release of Ball's first shoe, the ZO2. The $495 price tag on the shoe sparked wide criticism from celebrities and on social media. In response to his critics, LaVar tweeted on May 4, ""If you can't afford the ZO2S, you're NOT a BIG BALLER!"" It was later revealed that despite not being a founder of the company, Lonzo owned 51% of the Big Baller Brand, while his father owned 16.4% of the business and both his mother and Alan Foster owned 16.3% of the business. On April 6, 2018, Jordan Crawford became the first player besides Ball to wear the ZO2s during a game. On December 20, 2017, Ball was announced as the logo for the Junior Basketball Association (JBA), a league his father LaVar planned to establish for high-school basketball players who have finished high school but want an alternative option to the NCAA. In March 2019, Ball told ESPN.com that he had cut his ties with BBB's manager and co-founder Alan Foster, accusing him of his access to my business and personal finances to enrich himself"". In particular, he stated that $1.5 million of his personal money had gone missing. In addition, the Lakers showed concerns for the quality of BBB's shoes – believing it was a potential factor in his ankle injuries. Shortly afterward, Ball stripped references to BBB from his social media pages, changed his avatar to a childhood photo of himself wearing a Nike-branded T-shirt, permanently covered up his BBB tattoo, and posted a photograph of himself on Instagram with the caption ""Moving on to bigger and better #MyOwnMan"" . Ball and his family also discussed the idea of folding the Big Baller Brand altogether in the aftermath of Alan Foster's firing. In September 2017, Ball released his first rap single, ""Melo Ball 1"", an ode to his youngest brother, LaMelo. Not long after, during that same month, he released the song ""ZO2"", a dedication to his own brand of shoes. It would later be his lead single for his upcoming debut album. The following month, Ball released another rap single titled ""Super Saiyan"", which is a nod to the anime and manga series Dragon Ball Z. In the track, he compares himself to Goku, the main protagonist of DBZ. On February 15, 2018, Ball and his father would participate in the Lip Sync Battle as competitors. That same day, Ball released his debut album, Born 2 Ball, under the name Zo. The album would be released under the Big Baller Music Group, a subsidiary of the Big Baller Brand, run by a close friend of his father. In March, Born 2 Ball peaked at No. 42 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart and No. 13 on its Heatseekers Albums chart. In February 2017, Ball's mother Tina suffered a stroke and was hospitalized for two months. Ball had previously been in a long-term relationship with Denise Garcia, whom he met in high school, but they later split up in summer 2018. They have a daughter. Ball is a rap music enthusiast; in his spare time he writes lyrics on his phone, He also frequently goes to a studio to record music. He has said that he would be a rapper if he was not an NBA player. In August 2017, Ball and his family premiered in their Facebook Watch reality show, Ball in the Family.",26095,192,2019-20,47.0,38.0,1503.0,5.0,12.5,0.4,2.7,7.3,0.366,2.3,5.3,0.445,0.7,1.3,0.566,1.3,5.6,6.8,7.6,1.4,0.6,3.3,2.2,13.4,19.0,New Orleans Pelicans

His final four schools were Kentucky, Duke, Texas and Michigan. Ultimately, Bamba chose to play for the University of Texas for his college career. Before playing a single game for Texas, his half-brother Ibrahim Johnson posted a 22-minute-long video on Facebook Live, talking about how there were some illegal benefits from a Michigan-based investor involved during the decision-making and that he was reporting the information to the NCAA. However, the NCAA reported that nothing involved there would ultimately affect Bamba's eligibility for his freshman season. Bamba made his official college debut on November 10, 2017 against Northwestern State, recording 15 points and 8 rebounds in a blowout win that night. Eight days later, he recorded 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 blocks in a blowout win against Lipscomb.

At the 2018 NBA combine, Bamba measured near 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall and measured a 7 ft 10 in (2.39 m) wingspan, breaking the record that was previously held by current Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert. At a private workout, Bamba reportedly ran faster than most of the NBA, including MVP Russell Westbrook, since he had a 3.04 3/4 court sprint. Bamba refused to work out with the Memphis Grizzlies before the draft, and told them not to draft him. On June 21, 2018, Bamba was selected with the sixth overall pick by the Orlando Magic in the 2018 NBA draft. On July 3, 2018, Bamba officially signed a rookie scale contract with the Magic.

He went on to win an NBA championship with the Mavericks in 2011 before signing with the Minnesota Timberwolves, where he played for the next three seasons. He has also played in the NBA Development League and the Baloncesto Superior Nacional. Barea was a member of the Puerto Rican national team that won the gold medal in the 2006 and 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games.

Barea broke the single-game and single-tournament assist records, as he dished out 18 assists for Beach Barton Ford in a 118–100 victory over Norfolk Sports Club, giving him 41 assists in three games. For his efforts, Barea received the tournament's first Allen Iverson A.I. award, given to the player deemed most important to his team. After the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, Barea returned to Puerto Rico to join Cangrejeros de Santurce for the 2006 BSN season, where he averaged 10.4 points, 2.7 assists, and 2.8 rebounds over 9 games.After going undrafted in the 2006 NBA draft, Barea joined the Golden State Warriors for the 2006 Las Vegas Summer League where in five games, he averaged 6.8 points, 1.8 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 2 steals in 21.4 minutes per contest.

He also played two playoff games for the Mavericks, scoring 0 points in three and a half total minutes. In July 2007, Barea re-joined the Dallas Mavericks for the 2007 Las Vegas Summer League, where in five games, he averaged 16.0 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists in 27.6 minutes per game.

He also managed one playoff game where he contributed eight points against the New Orleans Hornets. On July 9, 2008, Barea re-signed with the Dallas Mavericks to a three-year deal. In 2008–09, Barea's role on the team increased dramatically. Injuries to Jerry Stackhouse, Josh Howard, and Jason Terry saw Barea's minutes per game double as coach Rick Carlisle began regularly using a three-guard lineup which included Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, and Barea to spark an offensive streak in games. On February 20, 2009, Barea scored a then career high 26 points during an 86–93 loss to the Houston Rockets. In the 2009 playoffs, Barea became a starter during the first round, replacing Antoine Wright in an effort to contain Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs. He put up 13 points and added 7 assists in his first playoff start. In 2009–10, Barea again played an important role off the bench for the Mavericks. Over 78 games (with 18 starts), he averaged 7.6 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 3.3 assists in 19.8 minutes per game. He scored a season-high 23 points two times during the season and played in all six of the Mavericks' playoff games, where they once again fell to the San Antonio Spurs in the first round.

In the second round of the 2011 playoffs, the Mavericks faced off against the defending champions, the Los Angeles Lakers. During the second game of the series, Barea converted 12 points coming off the bench to lead a fourth-quarter rally that secured the 93–81 win for Dallas. With the game already decided and 24 seconds remaining, Barea was clotheslined by Lakers' forward Ron Artest, for which Ron was subsequently suspended. After the game, the Lakers praised Barea's performance with Phil Jackson even comparing him to star point guard Chris Paul, while Kobe Bryant went on record saying that ""Barea kicked our asses"". The Mavericks won the final game of the series to advance past the Lakers. Barea was the second-leading scorer for his team, putting up 22 points to go along with 8 assists. At one point in the fourth quarter, Barea had darted down the lane and was in midair about to finish a layup when Lakers' center Andrew Bynum threw him an elbow; the flagrant foul caused Barea to fall down hard and Bynum to be immediately ejected. Barea recovered, however, and played the game to the end. He called the foul ""dangerous"". Initially Bynum was unapologetic about the incident, saying, ""We were getting embarrassed. They were breaking us down. So I just fouled somebody."" He later issued a formal apology to the league and to Barea. The NBA suspended Bynum for the first five games in the next season in consequence, but later shortened the suspension to four games due to the lockout-shortened season. The Mavericks advanced to the NBA Finals where they faced the Miami Heat led by Dwyane Wade and Lebron James. Coach Rick Carlisle decided to start Barea when they were down 1–2 in the series. Barea became a key player, being instrumental in changing the dynamic of the entire series and winning the next three games. The Mavericks defeated the Heat 4 games to 2 and so claimed their first NBA championship in franchise history. Barea became the second Puerto Rican player to ever win an NBA championship, following Butch Lee in 1980. Barea started in three of 21 playoff games that he played for the Mavericks, while averaging 8.9 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 3.4 assists in 18.6 minutes per game. After failed negotiations to re-sign with the Mavericks, Barea began looking elsewhere, but, because of the NBA lockout, he was unable to sign with another franchise. On December 14, 2011, following the conclusion of the lockout, Barea signed a four-year, $19 million contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. On December 26, 2011, Barea made his debut for the Timberwolves, recording 14 points, 2 assists, and 2 rebounds in a 100–104 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. However, Barea's season was hampered with ankle and thigh injuries as he managed only 41 of 66 games for the Timberwolves in 2011–12. Despite this, on March 23, 2012, Barea recorded his first career triple-double, putting up 25 points along with 10 rebounds and 14 assists in a 149–140 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. During the last weeks of the season, and with injuries to starters Ricky Rubio, Kevin Love, and Luke Ridnour, Barea became the starting point guard, averaging 15.8 points and 9.4 assists during the last 9 games. During that period, Barea tallied a season-high 28 points and a career-high 15 assists. Barea began the season with 21 points and 5 assists against the Sacramento Kings on November 2, 2012. However, in his fourth game, he sprained his left foot, which caused him to miss the next five contests. In December, Barea averaged more than 25 minutes and 12.7 points per game coming off the bench. He had his best game of the season on April 12, when he scored 23 points against the Utah Jazz. He finished that season with averages of 11.3 points, 4.0 assists, and 2.8 rebounds in 23.1 minutes per game. In 2013–14, Barea served as the Timberwolves back-up point guard behind Ricky Rubio. He had his best offensive game in November 15, against the Denver Nuggets, scoring 21 points to go with 4 assists. In January, Timberwolves star Kevin Love indirectly criticized teammates Barea and Dante Cunningham for their behavior during game timeouts. Barea finished the season averaging 8.4 points and 3.8 assists per game. On October 27, 2014, Barea was waived by the Timberwolves in the hope of returning to the Dallas Mavericks. On October 29, 2014, Barea signed with the Dallas Mavericks, returning to the franchise for a second stint. In his first game back for Dallas the following day, Barea received a standing ovation from the American Airlines Center crowd as he entered the game off the bench during the first quarter. He went on to record 4 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists in the 120–102 victory over the Utah Jazz. On February 11, 2015, Barea scored a season-high 22 points on 8-of-15 shooting in a 87–82 win over the Jazz. On July 16, 2015, Barea re-signed with the Mavericks to a four-year, $16 million contract. On December 23, 2015, Barea scored a career-high 32 points on 13-of-20 shooting during a 119–118 overtime win versus the Brooklyn Nets. Three days later, he made a career-high seven three-pointers and finished with 26 points in a 118–111 win over the Chicago Bulls. On March 30, 2016, he scored 26 points, including a go-ahead layup with 49.9 seconds left as the Mavericks rallied in the fourth quarter to beat the New York Knicks, 91–89. On April 6, he helped the Mavericks secure their fifth consecutive victory by recording game-highs of 27 points and 8 assists during an 88–86 win over the Houston Rockets. Having become the Mavericks' sparkplug late in the season with Deron Williams sidelined, Barea suffered his own injury on April 8, a right groin strain which forced him to leave the contest against the Memphis Grizzlies after only eight minutes. The groin injury continued to bother him for the rest of the regular season and into the Mavericks' first round playoff series with the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the Mavericks' season-opener on October 26, 2016, Barea scored 22 points in a 130–121 overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers. On December 19, 2016, he returned to action after missing a month with a strained right calf. He finished with 11 points in 13 minutes against the Denver Nuggets. He went back on the injured list in January 2017; then after sitting out 20 games with a left calf strain, he returned to the hardwood in a 105–96 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on March 10, during which he added 9 points to 3 assists in 14 minutes of play. On February 24, 2018, in a 97–90 loss to the Utah Jazz, Barea hit his 500th 3-point field goal as a Maverick, becoming only the eighth player in franchise history to reach 500 made 3-pointers.

On January 11, 2019, Barea suffered a torn right Achilles tendon in a contest against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He underwent surgery three days later. On August 19, 2019, Barea was re-signed by the Dallas Mavericks. Barea began his international career with Puerto Rico's Under-19 junior national team, participating in the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship where he tied for third place in the tournament's Most Valuable Player poll. His next international performance occurred at Caguas, Puerto Rico, in the Under-21 Centrobasket tournament, in which Puerto Rico won the gold medal. Barea was awarded the Most Valuable Player award after leading the tournament in scoring, assists, and steals. His last participation at the Under-21 level was at the 2005 FIBA Under-21 World Championship, where he finished fourth in scoring with an average of 17.6 points per game and led the competition in assists with 7.3 per game, as Puerto Rico took seventh. In July 2006, Barea made his debut for the senior national team in the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, where Puerto Rico captured the gold medal. In the championship game against Panama, Barea drilled the decisive three-point basket with fourteen seconds left to give Puerto Rico a final advantage. Puerto Rico finished the tournament undefeated after six straight victories. Barea was then named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. He was the primary point guard for the Puerto Rican team that won the silver medal in the 2007 Pan American Games. Later that year, he played limited minutes in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, where Puerto Rico won the bronze medal. In 2008, Barea partook in a series of preparatory tournaments before the 2008 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament. In these exhibition games, he played in the starting lineup. The Olympic Qualifying Tournament began on July 14, 2008, with Barea returning to the back-up point guard position behind Carlos Arroyo. Puerto Rico advanced to the finals, but did not qualify to the 2008 Summer Olympics. In this tournament, Barea had averages of 12.4 points, 2.2 assists, and 3.2 rebounds per game.

The Mavs' team plane made the trip five times, delivering a total of more than 100,000 pounds of food, water, power generators, and other supplies. Barea made the trip once while his stay-at-home wife ran the other four trips and focused full time on the relief efforts. Barea's efforts in helping Puerto Rico earned him the NBA's J.

Before the hurricane, his foundation focused on refurbishing basketball courts in poor areas. He holds several basketball clinics each summer throughout the island and usually donates uniforms and equipment for the youth leagues run by Tommy Zapata, who coached Barea from when he was a 3-year-old who could dribble the ball ambidextrously.",26097,204,2019-20,17.0,4.0,263.0,7.9,17.5,0.453,3.1,6.8,0.46,4.8,10.7,0.449,1.9,1.9,1.0,1.1,3.6,4.7,8.6,0.4,0.1,2.9,1.6,20.9,7.0,Dallas Mavericks

On February 26, 2014, Barton recorded a season-high 20 points and a career-high 11 rebounds in 124–80 win over the Brooklyn Nets. In a televised interview following the game, when asked by a reporter about a spontaneous ""Will Barton"" chant that had broken out late in the contest, the guard replied, ""I like to think I'm the people's champ,"" thereby instantly giving birth to a new nickname and a Trail Blazers meme. He went on to record 17 points and six rebounds on May 12 to help Portland win Game 4 of their semi-final match-up against the San Antonio Spurs. On February 19, 2015, Barton was traded, along with Víctor Claver, Thomas Robinson and a lottery-protected 2016 first-round pick, to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee.

As a youngster, Nicolas Batum was considered one of the most talented young players in Europe, as he was ranked #17 among international players born in 1988, by the scouting website DraftExpress.com at the time he entered the 2008 NBA draft.Batum was part of the junior French national team that won the 2004 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship.He was named the MVP of the 2006 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, as France won the gold medal at that tournament. In 2006, Batum was named the most valuable player of the Under-18 Albert Schweitzer Tournament in Mannheim, Germany, as part of the tournament-winning French national team.Batum averaged 19 points, over 5 rebounds, and over 2 steals per game, during the seven game tournament. While playing for Le Mans, Batum averaged 3.4 points (65.9% FG), 2.5 rebounds, 0.5 assist per game in 13 minutes for the 2006–2007 French league season,and 12.3 points (52.3%), 5.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game in 28 minutes for the 2007–2008 season.He delivered an impressive performanceat the 2007 Nike Hoop Summitscoring 23 points (9/13 FG, 3/5 for 3 pointers) in 28 minutes. He also grabbed four rebounds and recorded four steals.

After coming off the bench for the first three games of his NBA career, Batum moved into the starting lineup in place of Travis Outlaw in Portland's fourth game of the 2008–09 season, a 103–96 loss to the Utah Jazz. On March 13, 2009, Batum recorded a season-high 20 points to go along with a clutch three-pointer with 29.9 seconds left, en route to a 109–100 victory over the New Jersey Nets.Batum missed the first 45 games of the 2009–10 season due to torn cartilage in his right shoulder. He played in his first game of the season on January 25, 2010. Batum scored more than 30 points for the first time with a 31-point performance (including 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals) on February 27, 2010 against the Minnesota Timberwolves. On June 25, 2012, the Portland Trail Blazers extended a qualifying offer to Batum, making him a restricted free agent. Less than three weeks later Batum signed a $46 million/4 year offer sheet with the Minnesota Timberwolves. On July 18, 2012, the Trail Blazers elected to match the Timberwolves' offer, signing Batum to the team through the 2015–16 campaign. On November 16, 2012, Batum tied a career-high of 35 points in a 119–117 overtime win against the Houston Rockets. This was followed exactly one month later by a game in which Batum recorded the 15th ""five-by-five"" in the NBA since the 1985–86 season, and the first since Andrei Kirilenko in January 2006. In this effort Batum scored 11 points while racking up 10 assists, 5 rebounds, 5 blocks and 5 steals in a 95–94 win against the New Orleans Hornets. On January 21, 2013, Batum recorded his first triple-double in a 98–95 loss to the Washington Wizards, scoring 12 points and adding 10 rebounds, and 11 assists, in addition to 3 steals and 2 blocks. Batum had a career year in 2012–13, as he finished with career-highs in nearly every statistic. His biggest improvement was his passing; he averaged 4.9 assists, more than triple his previous career-high (1.5 assists per game during the 2010–11 season). On June 24, 2015, Batum was traded to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Gerald Henderson, Jr. and Noah Vonleh. On August 1, 2015, Batum played for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game. He made his debut for the Hornets in the team's season opener against the Miami Heat on October 28, recording 9 points and 6 rebounds in a 104–94 loss. On November 15, he scored a season-high 33 points in a 106–94 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. The following day, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, November 9 through Sunday, November 15. It was the first career Player of the Week award for Batum, who led the Hornets to a 3–1 record on the week. On December 9, he recorded his fifth career triple-double with 10 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in a 99–81 win over the Miami Heat. In early January, he missed four games with a right toe injury. Later that month, he missed three more games with the same injury. On March 29, he recorded his second triple-double of the season with 19 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists in a 100–85 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On April 20, Batum's first season with the Hornets came to an end after he suffered another injury, this time a sprained left ankle in Game 2 of the Hornets' first-round playoff series with the Miami Heat.

On December 23, 2016, he recorded his first triple-double of the season with 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a 103–91 win over the Chicago Bulls.

Batum made his season debut on November 15, 2017, scoring 16 points in 32 minutes as a starter in a 115–107 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. A week later, Batum left the Hornets' game against the Washington Wizards in the second quarter with a left elbow contusion and did not return.

Five days later, he recorded a career-high 16 assists to go with 10 points and 10 rebounds in a 129–117 win over the Hawks. On October 24, 2019, Batum was sidelined for two to three weeks due to an avulsion fracture on the third finger of his left hand. The lengthy and agile Batum is regarded as a highly skilled defensive player and one of the NBA's best executors of the chase-down block. Growing up in Pont-l'Évêque, Normandy, the lanky Batum had been among the tallest boys of his age group and had begun his basketball career as a center. Inspiration had been drawn from NBA shot-blocking specialist Dikembe Mutombo, known for theatrically wagging his finger after rejections — an affectation which Batum had emulated. Batum noted in a 2013 interview with the Portland Oregonian that as he got older, he was moved from the low post to the wing, where he was no longer able to make the face-up block a signature component of his game. ""I couldn't block it like I used to when I played inside, so when I would see a guy going down the court on a fast break, I used to run behind him and get the block"". The chase-down block thus became a fundamental part of Batum's game and was a superior skill brought with him to the NBA. Through March 2013, only two players in the 2012–13 season who did not play center or power forward had more blocks than Batum — Josh Smith and Kevin Durant. Batum played for the senior men's French national basketball team at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Late in a 66–59 quarterfinal loss to Spain, a frustrated Batum punched Spanish player Juan Carlos Navarro in the groin. After the game, Batum said, ""I wanted to give him a good reason to flop."" Batum later apologized on Twitter, writing, ""I showed a bad image of France and myself. Congrats to team Spain."" Batum was a member of the French national team that finished third-place in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, becoming the first French team to win a medal in a FIBA Basketball World Cup competition. In the final two games he averaged 31.0 points and was subsequently named to the all-tournament team. Note: The EuroLeague is not the only competition in which the player participated for the team during the season. He also played in domestic competition, and regional competition if applicable. His father, Richard, of Cameroonian origin, was a professional basketball player in France. Richard died during a game in 1991 after suffering an aneurysm. Batum has a younger sister named Pauline. In March 2017, Batum became a shareholder in Infinity Nine Sports, the company owned by Tony Parker, which runs French basketball club ASVEL Basket, and took over the position as director of basketball operations at ASVEL.",26104,254,2019-20,22.0,3.0,505.0,2.0,5.8,0.346,1.0,3.5,0.286,1.0,2.3,0.438,0.6,0.7,0.9,1.8,5.3,7.1,4.7,1.2,0.6,1.6,2.9,5.6,4.0,Charlotte Hornets

While with the Warriors, Bazemore was noted for his celebrations while on the team's bench, which became a fixture on YouTube and were included in the NBA 2K14 video game. In March 2016, ESPN writer Ethan Sherwood Strauss published a story about how Under Armour successfully signed away Stephen Curry from Nike in the 2013 offseason, and revealed that Bazemore played a significant role in the signing. During the 2012 offseason, when Bazemore was an undrafted rookie trying to make the Warriors roster, his agent contacted Under Armour and convinced the company to take a chance on Bazemore as an endorser, noting that rising Warriors stars Curry and Klay Thompson had endorsement deals set to expire in the near future. Under Armour signed Bazemore to a deal, mainly providing massive amounts of branded merchandise—enough to allow Bazemore to provide clothing to several Warriors staff members. Once Bazemore made the team, he and his fellow North Carolinian Curry bonded over their common origins and shared work ethic. Bazemore then sold Curry on signing with Under Armour, which he did following several missteps by Nike. According to Strauss, ""UA owes him [Bazemore] now. Big time."" As a result, Bazemore has a six-figure deal with the company, an unusually high amount for a player of his stature in the league. The company also recognized Bazemore's role in luring Curry by signing an apparel deal with Old Dominion for seven times the amount that the school had previously received from Nike. His deal with Under Armour enabled him to provide most of the funding for ODU's new basketball practice facility.",26108,263,2019-20,12.0,0.0,245.0,5.4,13.5,0.402,1.8,4.8,0.364,3.7,8.7,0.424,3.8,5.3,0.722,1.2,5.9,7.1,1.6,1.8,0.6,1.8,4.6,16.5,26.0,Sacramento Kings

Listed at 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) and 250 lbs (113 kg), he plays the center position.He was drafted 18th overall by the Pacers in the 2019 NBA draft.Born in Sagarejo, Bitadze started playing basketball professionally with VITA Tbilisi in the VTB United League. In 2015, he moved to Serbian club Mega Basket and was loaned to Serbian League team Smederevo 1953 in the following year. Upon his return to Mega in 2017–18, Bitadze was named most valuable player (MVP) of the Junior ABA League and became a key player for the senior team. At the end of 2018, he was loaned to Budućnost in Montenegro and was named EuroLeague Rising Star for the 2018–19 season. Bitadze is a member of the Georgian national basketball team. He was named to the national team at EuroBasket 2017 and made his debut at FIBA World Cup qualifiers in 2017. Previously, Bitadze represented Georgia at the junior level in FIBA competition. Bitadze was born in Sagarejo, a town in eastern Georgia.His father was a professional basketball player whose career was cut short by injury.Although Bitadze did not watch basketball in his childhood, he started playing the game when he was 6 years old, because he saw himself as ""active and tall.""As he became more involved in basketball, he began idolizing Georgian players Zaza Pachulia and Tornike Shengelia, as well as NBA stars Pau Gasol and Shaquille O'Neal.On 31 May 2013, Bitadze scored 17 points to help his school team Hyundai win the national under-14 championship over Gori.He also played in the Georgian under-16 league for three years.

Through 6 games, Bitadze averaged 2.8 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 0.7 blocks in 13.8 minutes per game. On 2 December 2015, he signed with Mega Basket of the Basketball League of Serbia (KLS) and ABA League. Bitadze was drawn to the club because it had produced many NBA players like Nikola Jokić and Ivica Zubac, and he thought the Serbian league was ""well run."" He described the move, ""It was hard for me for a couple of months. I was really frustrated, far away from my family and far away from my friends. It was hard, but then slowly I got used to it... you have to sacrifice in order to achieve something big and get something even bigger."" In December 2015, Bitadze averaged 7.8 points and 4 rebounds per game to help Mega's junior team win the Torneo Città di Roma and qualify for the 2015–16 Adidas Next Generation Tournament (ANGT).

In January 2018, Bitadze briefly played for Mega's junior team and helped capture the Junior ABA League championship. After averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds in the final tournament, he was named league MVP and earned Ideal Five recognition. On 20 January, Bitadze scored 23 points versus Cedevita, his season-high mark in the ABA League. He declared for the 2018 NBA draft on 12 April and was considered a possible second-round pick.

After Budućnost failed to qualify to the Playoffs of the EuroLeague, Bitadze returned to Mega for the rest of the season. On 20 April, he declared for the 2019 NBA draft, for which he was considered a possible lottery pick. On 19 June, during media availability for the draft, Bitadze appeared in a viral photo that showed him being ignored by reporters, who instead surrounded Zion Williamson, the eventual first overall pick, in the background. A number of NBA players, including Dwyane Wade and Draymond Green, suggested him to use the photo as motivation. He was drafted by the Indiana Pacers with the 18th pick overall in the 2019 NBA Draft. On July 15, 2019, the Indiana Pacers announced that they had signed with Bitadze. On October 28, 2019, Bitadze made his debut in NBA, coming off from bench in a 99–110 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers with two points and a rebound.

Bitadze was first named to the Georgian senior national team at EuroBasket 2017, but a calf ligament injury forced him to sit out of the entire competition. Regardless, he ""learned a lot on and off the court"" by observing his veteran teammates, including Zaza Pachulia and Giorgi Shermadini. On 24 November 2017, Bitadze debuted for the senior national team versus Germany during qualification for the 2019 FIBA World Cup, scoring 4 points in 17 minutes.

He was selected with the seventh overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings and subsequently traded to the Charlotte Bobcats (now Charlotte Hornets). Biyombo was born in Lubumbashi, Congo, to parents François and Françoise Biyombo along with his three brothers, Billy, Biska, and Bikim, and three sisters, Bimeline, Bikelene, and Bimela.He was discovered by coach Mário Palma at the age of 16 at a youth tournament in Yemen. His play impressed Palma and earned him an opportunity to train in Spain.Biyombo started the 2009–10 season with Fuenlabrada-Getafe Madrid of the EBA before moving to CB Illescas of the LEB Silver league. He also started the 2010–11 season with CB Illescas before moving to Baloncesto Fuenlabrada of the ACB league in January 2011.Biyombo made his debut in the Spanish ACB League with Fuenlabrada against DKV Joventut on January 9, 2011, recording 5 points and 7 rebounds in just over 13 minutes of play.In Fuenlabrada's narrow defeat to Real Madrid, he recorded 6 points and 3 blocks,one of them against former Spanish League MVP and Spanish national team player, Felipe Reyes.At the 2011 Nike Hoops Summit, Biyombo participated for the World Select Team (against the USA Select Team), and recorded a triple double, with 12 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 blocks. It was the first recorded triple-double in the Summit's history.Biyombo was drafted seventh overall by the Sacramento Kings in the 2011 NBA draft, but his rights were later traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in a draft night trade.On December 19, 2011, Biyombo signed a multi-year deal with the Bobcats.After averaging five points per game over his first two seasons with Charlotte, Biyombo's minutes and subsequent production dropped dramatically in 2013–14 as he fell out of favor with coach Steve Clifford, as he averaged just 2.9 points in 13.9 minutes per game. While his forte in defense and rebounding did drop in 2013–14, Biyombo began the 2014–15 season in much better form despite missing seven out of the first eight games of the season largely due to the acquisition of Jason Maxiell in the 2014 offseason.With the late-December injury to starting center Al Jefferson, Biyombo was placed into the starting line-up.On June 30, 2015, the Hornets decided not to extend a qualifying offer to Biyombo, making him an unrestricted free agent. On July 18, 2015, Biyombo signed a two-year, $5.7 million contract with the Toronto Raptors. On August 1, 2015, he played for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game. He made his debut for the Raptors in the team's season opener against the Indiana Pacers on October 28, recording 7 points and 5 rebounds in a 106–99 win. Biyombo started in 18 straight games between mid-November and late December while Jonas Valančiūnas was recovering from a fractured hand. On December 17, he recorded 8 points, a then career-high 18 rebounds, and a career-high tying 7 blocks in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. Five days later, he recorded 9 points and a then career-high 20 rebounds in a 103–99 win over the Dallas Mavericks. Biyombo returned to a bench role on December 30. He returned to the starting line-up in mid-March with Valančiūnas out injured again. On March 17, 2016, Biyombo scored a career-high 16 points and set a franchise record with 25 rebounds in guiding the Raptors to a 101–94 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers. On March 30, he recorded seven points and six rebounds in a 105–97 win over the Atlanta Hawks, helping the Raptors record a 50-win season for the first time in franchise history. The Raptors finished the regular season as the second seed in the Eastern Conference with a 56–26 record. In the first round of the playoffs, the Raptors faced the seventh-seeded Indiana Pacers, and in a Game 5 win on April 26, Biyombo recorded 10 points and 16 rebounds off the bench to help the Raptors take a 3–2 series lead. The Raptors went on to win the series 4–3, moving on to the second round where they faced the Miami Heat. In Game 7 of the Raptors' series with the Heat, Biyombo recorded 17 points and 16 rebounds as a starter in a 116–89 win, helping the Raptors advance to the conference finals for the first time in franchise history. In Game 3 of the conference finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Biyombo set a Toronto playoff record with 26 rebounds, helping the Raptors cut the Cavaliers' advantage in the series to 2–1. The Raptors went on to lose the series in six games. After declining his $2.9 million player option for the 2016–17 season, Biyombo became an unrestricted free agent on June 7, 2016. Biyombo later revealed that he wished to re-sign with the Raptors, but with the re-signing of DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors did not have the salary cap space to make it possible. On July 7, 2016, Biyombo signed a four-year, $72 million contract with the Orlando Magic. After exceeding the flagrant foul limit during the 2016 playoffs, Biyombo was forced to serve an NBA-mandated one-game suspension to begin the 2016–17 season. He made his debut for the Magic in the team's second game of the season on October 28, scoring two points in just under 23 minutes in a 108–82 loss to the Detroit Pistons.

He also represents the senior Serbian national basketball team internationally. Bjelica was an All-Euroleague First Team selection as well as the Euroleague MVP in 2015. Bjelica began playing basketball at Aca Janjić basketball school, before joining the youth selections of KK Partizan.He began his professional career in the 2007–08 season with the Arkadia Traiskirchen Lions of the Austrian League, averaging 8.5 points in 26 games.After one season abroad, he returned to the Serbian team Crvena zvezda, and spent two successful seasons there, under head coach Svetislav Pešić. During the 2008–09 season, he made breakthroughs, and earned a place in the first lineup. He was particularly noted for his performance during the EuroCup, for his outside shooting. Later in his career, Bjelica cited coach Pešić as one of the main reasons for his improvement as a player.Coach Pešić trusted Bjelica with the ball, and gave the 6""10 Bjelica a primary ball handler role on several occasions, which helped to develop Bjelica as a play-maker. Bjelica was drafted by the Washington Wizards with the 35th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. His draft rights were then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves.In August 2010, Bjelica signed a five-year contract with Spanish club Saski Baskonia.In his first season with the club, he didn't get much playing time, averaging only 9 minutes played per game. In his second season with Baskonia, he averaged 4.8 points per game, on 56% shooting from the field, and 47% shooting from 3 point range, three in 13 minutes played per game. His third and last season with the club was the most successful, as he played in 26 games, with the averages of 9.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 1 steal per game, on 46% shooting from the field. On July 22, 2013, Bjelica signed a three-year deal with the Turkish team Fenerbahçe Ülker, which was led by one of Europe's great coaches, Željko Obradović.He cited Obradović as the main reason why he didn't go to the NBA instead.In the 2013–14 season, he already became one of the key Fenerbahçe Ülker players, averaging all career-highs of 10.4 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.2 assists, and 1.6 steals per game, over 24 EuroLeague games. The following season, Bjelica's game saw its most improvement and consistency. On March 30, 2015, he was named the EuroLeague MVP of the Month for March, his first such monthly award in his career. Over 4 games played in March, he averaged 15 points, 9 rebounds, 3 assists, and 1 block per game. In May 2015, he was chosen to the All-EuroLeague First Team, for his performances over the season. Eventually, Bjelica was named the EuroLeague MVP of the season. Fenerbahçe also advanced to the EuroLeague Final Four for the first time in the team's history. On May 15, 2015, however, they lost in the semifinal game to Real Madrid, by a score of 87–96. Eventually, Fenerbahçe finished in 4th place, after losing in the third-place game to CSKA Moscow, by a score of 80–86. Bjelica had his best season since coming to the club, averaging a career-high 12.1 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and 1.3 steals per game.

He was also capped for the national team of Serbia at the EuroBasket 2011, in Lithuania, where Serbia finished eighth. During EuroBasket 2013 in Slovenia, Bjelica became one of the veterans of a very young and incomplete Serbia squad, leading the team alongside captain Nenad Krstić and Nemanja Nedović. Serbia was eventually swept by Spain in the quarterfinals, but the team showed some good performances, particularly against Lithuania and France. During the tournament, he averaged 10 points, 7 rebounds, and 1.9 assists per game, on 54% shooting from the field. He was also a member of the Serbian national basketball team that won the silver medal at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup under head coach Aleksandar Đorđević. Although his three point shooting form wasn't impressive during the tournament, he was still one of the most important players of the team, filling all sorts of roles with his handling, passing, rebounding, and scoring. He ended the tournament with averages of 11.9 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game. He was also a member of the team that represented Serbia at the EuroBasket 2015.

With wins over the United States and Czech Republic, it finished in fifth place. Bjelica's statistics suggest he was the third-best player on the team behind Bogdanović and Jokić, averaging 10.7 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists over 7 games, while shooting 42.9% from the field.

He scored in double digits 20 times, including four games with at least 20 points.In four NCAA tournament games, he averaged 15.3 points and set a Kentucky school record of eight made three-pointers in an NCAA tournament game against East Tennessee State in scoring a career-high 29 points (9-11 FG, 8-9 3 FG).Despite being a natural point guard, Bledsoe often filled the shooting guard role playing alongside fellow freshman John Wall. On April 7, 2010, Bledsoe declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility.In September 2010, it was reported that Bledsoe may have been ineligible to play his one season for Kentucky when discrepancies were found in his high school transcripts.The Alabama Public School System hired the independent law firm of White Arnold & Dowd to investigate claims that one of Bledsoe's grades was improperly changed.His algebra grade had been changed from a C to an A, thus raising his GPA high enough that he was eligible for the NCAA.Though the investigators concluded that the instructor's reasons for changing the grade were ""not credible"", and that a significant number of his high school grades were written over to reflect higher grades, the school board voted to allow the grade to stand, and the NCAA declared its investigation of Bledsoe's eligibility closed the following week. During pre-draft workout, Bledsoe was touted for his quickness, ball handling ability, and ability to hit the long ball. He was subsequently selected with the 18th overall pick in the 2010 NBA draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder, but was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers. In his first season, he averaged 6.7 points and 3.6 assists and started 25 games. As a result, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In his second season, due to the Clippers' acquisition of Chris Paul, he played only an average of 11 minutes per game, with only one start, and his stats dropped. In fact, during that season, he ended up being assigned to the Clippers' NBA Development League affiliate team, the Bakersfield Jam. However, during his third season, his statistics ended up rising in spite of still being behind Chris Paul for most of the games that he played. Bledsoe also participated in the 2013 All-Star Game's Slam Dunk Contest. On July 10, 2013, Bledsoe was traded to the Phoenix Suns alongside teammate Caron Butler in a three-way trade with the L.A. Clippers and the Milwaukee Bucks that sent the Suns' Jared Dudley and the Bucks' J. J. Redick to the Clippers with two different second round picks going to the Bucks. On his opening night debut with the Suns, Bledsoe helped the team by getting 22 points, 6 rebounds, and 7 assists in a 104-91 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. In his second game with the Suns, Bledsoe hit his first ever game-winning shot in an 87-84 home victory over the Utah Jazz. Before the November 19, 2013, game against the Sacramento Kings, Bledsoe's shin collided with teammate P. J. Tucker during practice. He would miss six games before returning with 17 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 steals in a 112-101 victory against the Jazz on November 29, 2013. Bledsoe gained a career-high 28 points in a 116-107 victory against the Sacramento Kings on December 13, 2013. Bledsoe also got his first double-double with the Suns by scoring 16 points, grabbing 11 rebounds, and putting up 7 assists in a blowout 117-90 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on December 23, 2013. During the third quarter of the Suns' last game of 2013 against the Clippers, Bledsoe injured his left shin. What began as a shin injury eventually turned into a meniscus injury that would leave him sidelined for nearly two and a half months. His injury was a leading factor in the Suns signing former player Leandro Barbosa back onto the team for the rest of that season. Bledsoe returned to action on March 12, 2014 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He started for the Suns again and racked up 17 points and 10 rebounds two days later in an 87-80 victory against the Boston Celtics. He continued to start for the team throughout the rest of the season. On November 14, 2019, Bledsoe scored 31 points, setting a new NBA career high, in a 124-115 victory over the Chicago Bulls. On June 27, 2014, the Suns extended a qualifying offer to Bledsoe, thus making him a restricted free agent. After months of deliberation and rumors concerning his future, Bledsoe and the Suns reached an agreement on a new five-year, $70 million contract on September 24, 2014. In the Suns' 2014–15 season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 29, 2014, Bledsoe recorded 16 points, nine assists, and six rebounds before he drew his second technical foul and was ejected with 30 seconds left in the third quarter.

In doing so, he became just the ninth player in NBA history to record similar kinds of statistics during the regular season, as well as the first point guard to record 50% shooting for 28 or more points while recording 13 or more rebounds, 9 or more assists, 4 or more blocks, and at least one steal in a game. On March 21, he scored a career-high 34 points in a 117–102 win over the Houston Rockets.

On December 13, in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, Bledsoe recorded 23 points with nine assists plus four steals and tied a career-high with four blocked shots. It was the NBA's first ""four-by-four"" (at least four rebounds, four assists, four steals and four blocks) by a guard since Dwyane Wade did it on February 28, 2009. On December 29, he underwent successful surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee and was subsequently ruled out for the remainder of the 2015–16 season. With Bledsoe out, the Suns managed just 11 more wins over the final three months of the season. On September 15, 2016, Bledsoe was cleared for his first five-on-five scrimmage play.

Two games later on February 1, Bledsoe tied his career high with another 41-point effort in a 124–114 loss to his former team, the Los Angeles Clippers. Bledsoe's three 40-points games within 11 days is the fewest days needed to post three 40-point games in Suns history—the record was previously 13, set by Charlie Scott in 1973. In the Suns' last game before the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend, on February 15, Bledsoe recorded his third career triple-double with 25 points, 10 rebounds, and 13 assists in a 137–101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. On March 15, he was shut down for the remainder of the season after battling knee soreness. On October 22, 2017, just three games into the season, Bledsoe tweeted out ""I Dont wanna be here"", which Suns general manager Ryan McDonough took as a slight against the organization and dismissed him from playing with the team. Bledsoe claimed that the tweet referred to being in a hair salon. On November 5, 2017, Bledsoe was fined $10,000 by the NBA for his tweet. That same day, it was reported that Bledsoe would return to Suns team facilities to work out with staff members.

The shooting guard also represents the Serbian national basketball team internationally. He was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the 27th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, with his draft rights being traded to the Sacramento Kings during the 2016 NBA draft. Bogdanović earned an All-EuroLeague First Team and a EuroBasket All-Tournament Team selection in 2017. He was named the 2017 All-Europe Player of the Year, by the international basketball website Eurobasket.com.Bogdanović began playing organized basketball with ŠKK Zvezdara, a club in Belgrade. In April 2008, he moved on to KK Žitko Basket (then known as Alimenti Basket), also from Belgrade. Playing with Žitko Basket under coach Dragan Jakovljević, Bogdanović was part of the team that in April 2010 earned third place in the 2009–10 Serbian junior league at the final eight tournament in Vršac,after beating Partizan juniors in the quarterfinal, losing 89-86 to Hemofarm juniors in the semifinal and beating FMP junior team 82-76 in the third place game. A few weeks later in May 2010, together with another Žitko player Luka Pajković, Bogdanović got attached to FMP's junior team featuring Nenad Miljenović, Stefan Popovski-Turanjanin, Nemanja Bezbradica, Nikola Janković, and Nikola Silađi for the Nike International Junior Tournament (NIJT) in Paris where the FMP juniors were defending their club's double title from previous two years. They were drawn in one of two round-robin groups at the tournament, alongside KK Split, Treviso, and Málaga. After beating Treviso and Split, FMP required a win over Málaga juniors to win their group and make the final; with precisely Bogdanović making the difference with an off-balance buzzer-beater for a 79-78 final score, two of his 21 points on the day alongside 6 rebounds.In the final game FMP took on INSEP and lost 73–83with Bogdanović having an outing to forget due to the mid-game injury that forced him to leave the contest. In September 2010, 18-year-old Bogdanović signed his first professional contract with Partizan.Initially, in his first two seasons with the crno-beli, under head coach Vlada Jovanović, Bogdanović didn't play much. With the summer 2012 return of head coach Duško Vujošević to Partizan, 20-year-old Bogdanović began to see increased minutes. After Danilo Anđušić's departure in December 2012, Bogdanović's role in the team stabilized even more.The 2012–13 season saw him make his EuroLeague debut with the team, averaging 5 points per game and 1.8 rebounds per game over 6 appearances. After being invited to play for the Serbian national team in the summer of 2013, he saw increased trust of coach Vujošević, which reflected on his minutes in the 2013–14 season, and a bigger role in the team. In the EuroLeague game is victory over CSKA Moscow in Belgrade, Bogdanović scored a career-high 27 points, shooting 10 for 16 from the field. Shortly after the game, he was praised by Serbian national team selector Aleksandar Đorđević, as being one of the most promising young European players. In a February ABA League away game versus Cibona, Bogdanović scored a career-high 32 points, also adding 4 rebounds and 5 assists. Over 23 games in the EuroLeague, he averaged 14.8 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game, all career-highs. In April 2014, along with his teammate Joffrey Lauvergne, he was selected to the Ideal Team of the ABA League. In May 2014, he was voted the EuroLeague Rising Star of the season, by the head coaches of 24 EuroLeague teams. Partizan finished the season by winning its 13th consecutive Serbian League title, after once again defeating their archrivals, Red Star Belgrade, 3-1 in the league's finals series. Bogdanović exploded in the finals series, averaging 30.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game. For such a performance, he was named the league's Finals MVP. Following Bogdanović's summer 2014 transfer from Partizan to Fenerbahce, the player's decision to leave the club was publicly criticized by Partizan's head coach Vujošević who claimed that by leaving in 2014 Bogdanović broke their verbal agreement the coach had struck with the player (along with Bogdanović's agent Aleksandar Rašković and his parents) two years earlier in 2012.Their 2012 agreement, according to the coach, saw then 20-year-old Bogdanović be placed immediately into Partizan's first team rotation in return for the player's promise he would stay with the team three more seasons from that point on.Bogdanović left the club in summer 2014, two years after the supposed agreement, following Partizan's failure to qualify for the next season's EuroLeague.On 11 July 2014, Bogdanović officially signed a four-year contract, containing opt-out clauses after the second and third seasons, with the Turkish team Fenerbahçe. Over four years, Bogdanović is slated to make €3.5 million euros net income, while Partizan also received a €1.3 million euros buyout from Fenerbahçe, as the player was still under contract with the Belgrade club. Even though Bogdanović was a newcomer in the team, head coach Željko Obradović gave him a significant number of minutes and a starter role. With the beginning of the 2014–15 season, he struggled in shooting and consistency. On 15 November, in a 93–86 win over FC Bayern Munich, he scored 18 points and added 7 assists, his best game since coming to the new team. Over 10 games in the first phase of the EuroLeague, he averaged 10.4 points and 3.4 assists per game. On 20 March, Bogdanović set a season-high of 25 points, and added 4 assists, in a 98–77 win over Emporio Armani Milano.

On 26 March, in a game against Unicaja Málaga, he scored a 20-meter distance buzzer beater at the end of the second quarter. After good showings in the Top 16, he struggled in shooting in the quarter-final playoff series against Maccabi Tel Aviv, averaging 8 points on 25% shooting from the field. Eventually, Fenerbahçe won the EuroLeague playoff series, and advanced to the 2015 Euroleague Final Four, the first in the club's history. On 7 May, he was voted the EuroLeague Rising Star for the second season in a row, becoming only the second player, after Nikola Mirotić, to win the award twice.

Also, in 36 games of the Turkish League, he averaged 11.5 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.

Occasionally, in the late phases of the games, he also had the ball in his hands. Fenerbahçe won the Turkish Cup, with a 67–65 win over Darüşşafaka, with Bogdanović being named the Cup MVP. Fenerbahçe also reached the final game of the 2016 Euroleague Final Four, but fell short of winning the EuroLeague championship, after an overtime 96–101 loss to CSKA Moscow. Over 28 EuroLeague games, he averaged 11.7 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. At the end of the season, Fenerbahçe won the Tukish League championship. On 26 October 2016, in a EuroLeague game against Žalgiris Kaunas, Bogdanović sprained his right ankle; at first it was estimated that he will need two to three weeks of recovery time, but recovery didn't seem to go as expected as he didn't return until January 2017. On 6 January 2017, he returned on the court, in a game against Milano. Bogdanović proved to be a major contributor for Fenerbaçhe in the EuroLeague playoffs, as he would be the team's leading scorer in their first two games against Panathinaikos, before his club ultimately swept them, to earn another EuroLeague Final Four appearance. As a result of his contributions, he was not only named the EuroLeague's Player of the Round during those first two playoff games, but he was also named the EuroLeague's Player of the Month, for his overall work that month. He later helped Fenerbaçhe repeat their place in the Finals of the EuroLeague, after helping them defeat Real Madrid, in the EuroLeague Final Four semifinals, by a score of 84–75.

In the summer of 2010, Bogdanović was selected to represent Serbia by head coach Jovanović for the European under-18 Championship wherein they finished fourth in the tournament.

In the last few pre-tournament friendly games for the EuroBasket 2015, Serbian team head coach Đorđević put Bogdanović on the bench due to the twenty-three-year-old player's persistent back injury problems. Despite that, he was named to the 12-man roster that represented Serbia at the EuroBasket. Throughout the first phase of the tournament, playing with pain injections, he saw limited minutes, and his production slightly decreased from the previous summer. Despite that, Serbia dominated in the tournament's toughest group, Group B, with a 5-0 record, and then eliminated Finland and Czech Republic in the round of 16 and quarterfinal games, respectively.

He attended Moss Point High School in Moss Point, Mississippi and played in the 2014 McDonald's All-American Game,before spending one season playing college basketball for the University of Kentucky.He was drafted 13th overall in the 2015 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns. On March 24, 2017, Booker became the youngest player to score over 60 points in a game, finishing with 70 against the Boston Celtics.In March 2019, at 22 years old, Booker became the youngest player in NBA history with consecutive 50-point games.His father, Melvin Booker, played for three teams in the NBA.Booker received his first All-Star selection in 2020. Booker is the son of Veronica Gutiérrez and Melvin Booker, who was named the 1994 Big Eight Player of the Year while a point guard at Missouri. His parents met while his father was playing basketball for the Continental Basketball Association's Grand Rapids Hoops in Gutiérrez's hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Booker was born and raised in Grand Rapids, living with his Mexican American and Puerto Rican mother while his father pursued a professional basketball career internationally. He visited his father regularly during the summer. Booker was taught by his father that having basketball IQ was just as important as natural athleticism. During his time in middle school, Booker became friends with future fellow NBA players D'Angelo Russell and Tyler Ulis. After playing for the freshman, junior varsity and varsity basketball teams during his freshman year at Grandville High School in Michigan, Booker moved to Mississippi to live with his father after the latter's retirement from professional basketball. He enrolled at Moss Point High School, where his father was hired as an assistant coach, in August 2011. In his team's fifth game of the season—a 52–32 loss to Gulfport High School—Booker scored more points (17) than the rest of his teammates combined (15). In December, he hit a buzzer beater from just beyond half court to beat Harrison Central High School, improving Moss Point's record to 4–6 on the year. By early January, Press-Register sportswriter Creg Stephenson opined, ""Sophomore guard Devin Booker has developed into one of the top players on the coast in his first season with the [Moss Point] Tigers' varsity, averaging 22.7 points per game."" In the Laurel MLK Shootout, Booker scored 54 points against Northeast Jones High School, falling nine shy of Litterial Green's Moss Point record for most points in a game, set in 1988. He followed up that performance with 32 points, including a game-winning three-pointer, against Murrah High School and was named ESPNHS.com's Southeast Player of the Week. At that time, his father told reporters that Booker was drawing interest from Mississippi State, Ole Miss, Florida, Alabama, Georgetown, Michigan and Missouri. Booker was limited to just 14 points, with no field goals made in the second half, in a 57–55 win over Gautier High School in the opening round of the Division 7-5A tournament.

Wayne County focused their defense on Booker, holding him to a single, first-quarter free throw, en route to a 57–37 victory that ended Moss Point's season. For the year, Booker averaged 22.8 points per game and was named the South Mississippi Player of the Year by the Sun Herald, becoming just the second sophomore to be awarded the honor. In the announcement, the paper reported that Booker held scholarship offers from Ole Miss, Alabama, Georgetown, Michigan and South Alabama. In the summer following his sophomore year, Booker played in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League and participated in the Elite 100 Camp, the LeBron James King's Academy Camp, and the Kevin Durant Nike Skills Camp. These commitments caused him to miss the inaugural South Mississippi All-Star Basketball Showcase in May. With most of Moss Point's experienced players graduating, Booker switched to point guard for his junior year. In an early December game, Booker outscored the entire Ocean Springs High School team 40–39 through three quarters en route to a 48-point finish as Moss Point won 100–55. After the game, a Sun Herald reporter wrote of Booker, ""He's extremely athletic, can shoot the lights out and plays with a high degree of energy no matter if he's on offense or defense. Booker uses his quickness and long wingspan to deny pass after pass. And when he gets his hands on a steal, he knows exactly what to do with it."" He followed up this performance with a 30-point outing, including 7 three-pointers, in a win over 54–37 win over Laurel High School in the second annual Melvin Booker Shootout, named in honor of his father. The following week, Booker left a game against Harrison Central High School in the third quarter with a sprained MCL; he had scored just 9 points, but grabbed 7 rebounds. Booker's injury proved minor, and did not hamper him in Moss Point's next game, where he scored 26 points in a 52–48 loss to Davidson High School in the Jackie Laird Christmas Classic at Biloxi High School. On the second day of the Classic, Booker scored a season-high 49 points in an 80–65 win over Brewbaker Technology Magnet High School, a performance that added Duke to the list of schools recruiting him. In early January, Moss Point went 1–2 in the Poplar Bluff showdown in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, defeating Memphis' Kirby High School but losing to Maplewood Richmond Heights High School and host Poplar Bluff High School. University of Missouri fans attended en masse to cheer for Booker, who averaged 30.2 points over Moss Point's three games, hoping to entice him to play for the Tigers. Booker scored a game-high 32 points in a 58–56 loss to Gulfport High School, the top-ranked team in Mississippi, in Moss Point's final game before divisional play, dropping the team's record to 6–11.

Moss Point closed out the regular season with a 67–65 loss to Division 5-6A champion Hattiesburg High School, despite 43 points from Booker. The following week, Moss Point faced a rematch with Gautier in the first round of the Division 7-5A tournament with a spot in the state tournament on the line.

At the South Mississippi All-Star event in May, Booker scored 23 points to lead his East team over the West team 101–70 in the underclassman game.

Near the beginning of October, his high school coach said Booker would announce his college choice on October 31 after taking official visits to Michigan and Missouri; he also stated that Booker was no longer considering Florida. Booker stated that ESPN had offered him the chance to make his announcement on live television, but he declined, saying he didn't want the pressure of such an event and that he wanted to keep the date flexible to allow his family from Michigan to attend. At an October 31 ceremony at his high school gymnasium, Booker announced he had chosen Kentucky, citing the program's history and his affinity for coach John Calipari as primary factors in his decision. He, Tyler Ulis, Karl-Anthony Towns and Trey Lyles all signed National Letters of Intent to play for Kentucky on November 13, the first day of the official signing period. In December, Booker's Moss Point team traveled to the Marshall County Hoop Fest in Marshall County, Kentucky, to play Louisville's Ballard High School, the top-rated high school team in the state.

Two games later, he scored a season-high 45 points in a 78–67 loss to Alabama's McGill-Toolen Catholic High School in the Melvin Booker Shootout. Although Moss Point lost all three games they played in the late-December HighSchoolOT.com Invitational, Booker's 111 total points over those three games fell just four short of Donald Williams' 1991 record for the event. Booker's 38-point performance in a January 31 win against Pass Christian High School made him Moss Point's all-time career scoring leader with 2,263 points, surpassing the 2006 mark of 2,251 set by David Booker (no relation). Moss Point won Mississippi's Region 8-4A regular season and tournament championships before ending their season with a 61–56 loss to McComb High School in the Class 4A South State Finals.

Booker joined future Kentucky teammates Ulis and Lyles on the West team in the 2014 McDonald's All-American Game, while Towns suited up for the East.

He went on to make his NBA debut two days before his 19th birthday, in the Suns' season opener against the Dallas Mavericks. He became the first player in NBA history to debut at 18 years old after playing at least one year of college basketball. In 21 minutes of action against the Mavericks, he scored 14 points on 6-of-7 shooting in a 111–95 loss. While he began the season as a backup shooting guard throughout the early portion of the season, including starts on November 23 and December 21, a late December injury to starting guard Eric Bledsoe on December 26 led to Booker's promotion to the starting line-up for the rest of the season. Before his teammate's injury, Booker was producing averages of 5.4 points, 0.9 rebounds, and 0.8 assists in 14.1 minutes of play. His production then increased throughout the second half of the season. On January 2, 2016, Booker scored a then season-high 21 points in a 142–119 loss to the Sacramento Kings. Only Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, LeBron James, Dwight Howard and Kevin Durant scored 20+ points more than once at a younger age than Booker.

Redick in a tiebreaker event after the first round, where he finished third behind the ""Splash Brothers"" – Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson (winner). On March 3, Booker scored a then career-high 34 points in a loss to the Miami Heat, becoming the first Suns rookie since Richard Dumas in the 1992–93 season to record multiple 30+ point games for the team and the fourth-youngest player to do it in a season. His third 30-point game came on March 9 against the New York Knicks, finishing with 32 points to join Walter Davis (17) and Alvan Adams (6) as the only Suns rookies with 3+ 30-point games. A day later, Booker recorded his second-straight 30+ point game (third in a week and fourth overall at the time) by setting a new career-high with 35 points in a loss to the Denver Nuggets, joining LeBron James as the only teenagers in NBA history with back-to-back 30+ point games. On March 12, he recorded his third double-double of the season with 18 points and a career-high 11 assists in a 123–116 loss to the Golden State Warriors, becoming the first Suns rookie with multiple points/assists double-doubles since Negele Knight (3) in the 1990–91 season.

On April 9, with 16 points scored in a 121–100 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, Booker reached 1,014 for the season, making him the fourth-youngest player to reach 1,000 career points, following only LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant, as well as the third-youngest during their rookie season. Booker finished his rookie campaign with 1,048 points at an average of 13.8 per game. He appeared in 76 of the team's 82 games in 2015–16, a season that saw the Suns finish with the second-worst record in the West (23–59) and the second-worst record in franchise history.

He finished fourth in the 2016 NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting and earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors. He became the first Suns player to be named an All-Rookie Team member since Amar'e Stoudemire in 2003.

On March 24 against the Boston Celtics, Booker became the sixth player in NBA history to score 70 points in a game, joining Wilt Chamberlain, David Robinson, David Thompson, Elgin Baylor and Kobe Bryant.

On October 28, 2017, Booker scored 34 points in a 114–107 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers for his 21st career 30+ point game, setting the third-most 30-point games in NBA history before turning 21 years old, behind LeBron James (57) and Kevin Durant (28). On November 6, he scored 18 points in a 98–92 loss to the Brooklyn Nets to reach 3,000 career points and the fourth-youngest player in NBA history to score 3,000 points, behind LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Carmelo Anthony. On November 13, a 36-point game and 26th 30-point in his career tied Steve Nash for 15th most in franchise history. Over the Suns' first 17 games of the season, Booker had seven 30-point games. In Suns history, only Charlie Scott (8 in 1974–75) has had more 30-point performances in the same span. On December 2, he scored 38 points in a 116–111 loss to the Boston Celtics, joining Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor as the only players in NBA history to follow up a 70-point performance with 32+ points in their next game against that same opponent. Two days later, he scored his season-high 46 points in a 115–101 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 6, he was ruled out for up to three weeks after sustaining a left adductor strain the previous night against the Toronto Raptors.

Booker missed the Suns' final 12 games of the season with a right hand sprain. On July 7, 2018, Booker signed a five-year, $158 million maximum contract extension with the Suns.

On November 23, 2019, Booker almost put up a triple-double with 35 points, a career-high 12 rebounds, and 9 assists in a 100–98 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. From December 27, 2019 until January 7, 2020, Booker scored over 30 points in seven straight games, including a 40 point performance in a loss against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 5. This streak broke a franchise record for most consecutive 30+ point games in a row, beating a record previously set by Charlie Scott twice and Charles Barkley once.

He is known for his frequent contributions to two genres, science fiction and crime dramas, and worked on series such as Doctor Who, Blake's 7, Bergerac, The Bill and Star Cops. Prior to becoming a television writer, Boucher had worked at Calor Gas as a management trainee and he also gained a Bachelor of Arts in Economics at the University of Essex.In science fiction, he wrote three Doctor Who serials in the late 1970s: The Face of Evil, The Robots of Death and Image of the Fendahl. One of his contributions to Doctor Who was the creation of the character Leela (Louise Jameson), the savage companion who featured in the series during 1977 and 1978. The character was inspired by the Palestinian terrorist Leila Khaled.Boucher was commissioned for the programme by Robert Holmes, who suggested that Boucher should be appointed as script editor for the science fiction series Blake's 7 (1978–81). He served in this role for the entirety of its four-series run, and also wrote several episodes himself, including the final episode.In 1987 he created his own series Star Cops, which combined the science fiction and crime genres. The series encountered several production problems and was not a ratings success,lasting only nine episodes.In the genre of police dramas, between working on Doctor Who and Blake's 7, Boucher was the script editor on the second season of the drama Shoestring, which followed the investigations of private detective and radio show host Eddie Shoestring. In 1982, following the end of Blake's 7, Boucher script edited and wrote for the third season police drama Juliet Bravo. He later moved on to script edit the detective show Bergerac, working on the programme throughout the 1980s. All of the above television programmes were produced in-house by the BBC and broadcast on the BBC 1 network, with the exception of Star Cops which was shown on BBC 2. For the ITV network, he briefly contributed to Thames Television's police drama The Bill during the mid-1980s. Later works included several Doctor Who novels for BBC Books, all featuring the character of Leela,and a series of straight-to-CD full-cast audio dramas entitled Kaldor City, which combine elements from his Doctor Who serial The Robots of Death with his Blake's 7 work.

He originally committed to play college basketball for the Louisville Cardinals but was suspended by the team after a national college basketball corruption scandal which alleged that his family accepted payments in exchange for him choosing to attend Louisville. He later tried to play for the South Carolina Gamecocks, but due to an NCAA ruling, he removed himself from college and the 2018 NBA Draft altogether. Nicknamed ""Tugs"", he was named a McDonald's All-American as a senior in high school in 2017. Bowen played at Arthur Hill High School in Saginaw, Michigan, before transferring to La Lumiere School in La Porte, Indiana, in 2015.He had three points in the 2017 McDonald's All-American Boys Game.As a senior at La Lumiere, he had averaged 22 points per contest, while leading his team to a national championship at the Dick's Sporting Goods high school tournament.In the 2017 Jordan Brand Classic, he scored a game high 26 points, including 6-of-7 from beyond the arc, and was named co-MVP.Bowen was the last five-star recruit in the class of 2017 to announce his college commitment. It was announced on June 3, 2017, that he would be enrolling at Louisville.He reportedly also had offers from Michigan State, Arizona, UCLA, Oregon, Texas, DePaul and Creighton on the table.In September 2017, a Federal Bureau of Investigation investigative report into a college basketball corruption scandal made an ostensibly anonymous reference to alleged payments to the family of a student-athlete named only as ""Player-10"" who was recruited by an institution named only as ""University-6"".That university was described in such a way that it could only have been the University of Louisville. Player-10's signing was reportedly announced on or about June 3, 2017, and Bowen was the only Louisville player whose signing was in fact announced on or about that day. At the end of the summer, he enrolled in classes and began participating in preseason team activities as scheduled.On September 27, 2017, Louisville coach Rick Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich were placed on administrative leave, and eventually dismissed. On the same day, Bowen was also suspended from all team activities, but he continued to be enrolled in the school and he still had his scholarship. On November 3, 2017, Bowen was cleared by the FBI. On November 22, 2017, Louisville announced that Bowen will not play or practice for the team. Academically, he was still a student in good standing at the time. On January 10, 2018, University of South Carolina coach Frank Martin announced that Bowen had enrolled at the university and would join the Gamecocks' basketball program. The university anticipated that Bowen would have to sit out the next two semesters, due to NCAA transfer regulations, meaning he would be able to begin playing within January 2019. However, on April 18, 2018, Bowen announced his intentions on entering the 2018 NBA Draft, with him later being one of 69 players to enter that year's NBA Draft Combine. He would do so without hiring an agent, meaning he originally planned to return properly, but only if his confirmation on his transfer would be approved by the May 30 deadline. However, by that point in time, he had heard from the NCAA that he would have been forced to sit out for at least another season due to the combination of alleged benefits that were given to his family back when he committed to Louisville and his transfer soon afterward to South Carolina. As a result, he officially announced his entry for the 2018 NBA Draft that day instead of returning to college. However, on the June 11 international deadline, Bowen announced his withdrawal from the 2018 draft, which would allow him to either play in the NBA G League or overseas professionally before potentially returning in a future NBA Draft. After withdrawing from the 2018 NBA draft during the final entry deadline, Bowen made the decision to forgo college and pursue a professional contract. On August 7, 2018, Bowen signed with the Sydney Kings of the Australian NBL. During the 2018–19 NBL season, he played in 30 games while averaging 6.3 points and 3.2 rebounds per game. At the season's end, Bowen became automatically eligible for the 2019 NBA draft. Bowen was not selected in the 2019 NBA draft.

Bowman finished his collegiate career with 1,661 points scored, 627 rebounds, and 382 assists in 98 games. Bowman received an invitation to participate in the NBA Draft Combine but ultimately went unselected in the Draft, reportedly due to his reluctance to sign a two-way contract and a desire to evaluate his options as an undrafted free agent.He signed a one-year contract with the Golden State Warriors the following day on June 21, 2019 to join their Summer League team and averaged 3.3 points, 1.9 assists and 1.7 rebounds in seven Summer League games.

On January 14, 2011, Bradley was assigned to the Maine Red Claws of the NBA Development League and on the same day made his debut game for the team, playing 21 minutes and scoring 11 points. Following a spinal cord injury to Marquis Daniels during a game against the Orlando Magic on February 6, 2011, Bradley was recalled by the Boston Celtics on February 7, and joined the team for the game against the Charlotte Bobcats. In the one Celtics game of Bradley's rookie season in which he played more than 15 minutes, Bradley scored 20 points to go with three rebounds, two assists and two steals. However, he played ten or more minutes in just two other NBA games and did not appear in any of the Celtics' postseason contests. On June 30, 2011, the Celtics exercised their third-year team option on Bradley's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2012–13 season. In October 2011, Bradley signed with Hapoel Jerusalem of the Israeli Basketball Premier League for the duration of the NBA lockout. He played three games with the team, averaging 13.7 points per game. During the 2011–12 NBA season, Bradley enjoyed much more playing time and was promoted to a starting role following an injury to Ray Allen. Bradley's scoring output increased significantly during the season, and he managed a career-high 28 points against the Atlanta Hawks on April 20, 2012. He also received praise for his tremendous hustle and defense, including memorable blocks on Dwyane Wade and Russell Westbrook, among others. However, Bradley suffered a dislocated shoulder during the 2012 NBA Playoffs. This injury, which led to season-ending surgery, was a significant setback to the Celtics, who lost in seven games to the Miami Heat in the Conference Finals. On October 30, 2012, the Celtics exercised their fourth-year team option on Bradley's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2013–14 season. With Bradley still sidelined for the beginning of the 2012–13 NBA season, the aging Celtics struggled with the duo of Courtney Lee and Jason Terry receiving the majority of minutes at shooting guard. On January 2, 2013, Bradley returned to action against the Memphis Grizzlies, regaining his spot as the starting shooting guard and providing a significant boost to the team, evident by their winning six out of Bradley's first seven games back. However, the season was ultimately a disappointment for both Bradley and the Celtics. Although he led the league in fewest points per play allowed on defense, at 0.697, he struggled offensively, shooting just 40.2 percent from the field and managing 15 or more points just five times in 50 regular-season games. The Celtics lost any realistic chance of contention when point guard Rajon Rondo went down with a torn ACL on January 27, leaving them without their most dynamic player. After falling behind three games to none against the New York Knicks in the first round of the playoffs, Boston mounted a furious comeback, winning two games and narrowly losing Game 6. Bradley, whose play in the series had mirrored the ineffectiveness of the team, provided a gutsy effort at the end of the game, making all four of his shots and stealing the ball three times in the last ten minutes. The Celtics entered the offseason with an eye toward the future and Bradley a vital part of their plans to rebuild a contender. The Celtics ended an era on the day of the 2013 NBA draft, trading aging stars Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, as well as Jason Terry and D. J. White, to the Brooklyn Nets. The Celtics also declined to sign Bradley to a contract extension before the October 31, 2013 deadline, allowing him to become a restricted free agent in 2014. However, new Celtics coach Brad Stevens professed his trust in Bradley, who, in the absence of the injured Rondo, began the 2013–14 NBA season as the team's starting point guard. Bradley's time at point guard lasted just four disappointing games; he had more turnovers than assists, and the Celtics lost all four times. In an effort to turn the team around, Stevens named Jordan Crawford the new point guard, allowing Bradley to move to his natural shooting guard. The move worked brilliantly, as the Celtics immediately went on a four-game winning streak and the more comfortable Bradley settled nicely into his role on the team. Although the Celtics' lack of talent and experience began to show itself as the season went along, particularly with Rondo still out, Bradley was a rare bright spot, increasing his scoring average every month through January. He was especially effective in December, shooting a fantastic 50 percent on three-pointers and making 48.7 percent of his shots overall. Unfortunately, on January 21, in just the third game all season that Rondo was active, Bradley sprained his right ankle and ended up missing five contests. Shortly after returning, on February 5, he re-sprained the same ankle. Determined to be cautious, Stevens still had not set a return date for Bradley as the Celtics headed into the All-Star break more than a week later. Bradley ultimately returned to action on March 14. In his fourth game back, a win over the Miami Heat, he connected on a career-high six three-pointers as part of a 23-point effort, then followed it up with 28 points, matching his career high, the next game. When healthy, Bradley played significant minutes and played effectively in the final stretch of the season, scoring at least 18 points in the team's last five games. Bradley shouldered a higher percentage of the offensive workload for Celtics in 2013–14, and he responded by greatly improving his shooting from the previous season. In a rebuilding year for the team, one that saw them win only 25 games, Bradley stood out as one of their few consistent performers. With Bradley set to become a restricted free agent in July 2014, the Celtics needed to extend a qualifying offer of $3.6 million in order to be able to match any contract offered by another team, which they did on June 30. On July 15, Bradley re-signed with the Celtics to a four-year, $32 million contract. Although the Celtics had high hopes for their backcourt pairing of Bradley and Rajon Rondo, both now healthy, they were soon dealt a setback when Rondo broke his hand a month before the 2014–15 season. Although the team planned to be cautious with Rondo's injury, Brad Stevens made the decision to keep Bradley at shooting guard even with Rondo out, with a mix of rookie Marcus Smart, second-year guard Phil Pressey and new acquisition Evan Turner playing point guard. Despite the concerns, Rondo ultimately surprised many by being ready for opening night. Bradley continued to play harassing defense and scored in double digits in 13 of the team's first 15 games, including a career-high 32 points in a loss to the Dallas Mavericks. The Celtics, however, struggled to a 4–11 start. Meanwhile, Bradley's offense cooled off in December, as he shot just 39 percent from the field for that month and made just 1-of-21 three-point attempts over a six-game stretch. Faced with a 9–14 record on December 18, Celtics President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge made the difficult decision to part with Rondo, trading him and rookie Dwight Powell to the Dallas Mavericks for Brandan Wright, Jae Crowder, Jameer Nelson and two draft picks. Pundits such as Bill Simmons and Jalen Rose portrayed the trade as a surrender to a mediocrity, with the hopes of getting a high draft pick at season's end, and the Celtics continued to struggle after Rondo's exit. However, under the tutelage of Brad Stevens, and with the help of trade acquisition Isaiah Thomas, the young Celtics gradually improved. After failing to post winning records in November, December or January, they did so in February, March and April, and won eight of the season's last nine games. Bradley's offensive output was especially effective in February, as he managed over 18 points per game in the month while shooting 47 percent from the field and over 40 percent from three-point range. Although a shoulder injury sidelined him for three games between March 6 and 9, he returned to score 17 points against the Memphis Grizzlies on March 11. For the regular season, Bradley led the Celtics in minutes played and points, although his points per game and shooting percentages declined slightly from 2013–14. A 40–42 record saw the Celtics earn the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. Their playoff series was brief, as the eventual conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers swept the Celtics 4–0. Bradley played 40 out of the 48 minutes in the last game of the series, but his 16 points was not enough to overcome LeBron James and the Cavaliers. Nevertheless, the 2014–15 season was a surprise success for the Celtics and another solid year, and a relatively healthy year, for Bradley. Fresh off of their first playoff appearance in the Brad Stevens era, the Celtics entered 2015–16 campaign eager to prove that it had not been a fluke. Acquiring veteran forwards David Lee and Amir Johnson to fortify their frontcourt, the team also hoped to see the continued improvement of their promising young players, including Marcus Smart and Jared Sullinger. They started the year off slow, winning just one of their first four. Bradley provided a rare highlight, however, throwing down a tremendous dunk on reigning Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard. After missing two games with a calf injury, Bradley returned to action as a sixth man after starting 224 of 226 Celtics games in which he was healthy. He excelled in his new role, improving his scoring, efficiency and defensive rating. Bradley soon returned to the starting lineup on November 22 and proved himself highly capable in either role, immediately managing two games in a row with at least 25 points and 13 in a row with at least 10 points. Bradley missed three games in early January with a hip injury, and upon his return, the Celtics emerged as one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. Bradley contributed a number of memorable performances. On January 27, he scored 21 of his season-high tying 27 points in the first half of the Celtics' 111–103 win over the Denver Nuggets. On February 5, he connected on a game-winning three-pointer to give Boston a 104–103 win over the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers. On February 29, he blocked a shot from Utah Jazz forward Gordon Hayward with 23 seconds left in the game to give the Celtics a win. For the season, Bradley was his team's second leading scorer, behind only All-Star Isaiah Thomas. With a 48–34 record, the Celtics finished the regular season in a four-way tie for the third seed in Eastern Conference and were assigned the fifth seed based on tiebreaker rules. Drawing the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs, the Celtics narrowly lost in Game 1, as Bradley scored 18 points but went down in the fourth quarter with an apparent right hamstring injury. The injury turned out to be serious enough to sideline Bradley for the rest of the series, which turned out to be a crippling blow for the Celtics. They were considerably outplayed by the Hawks in his absence, particularly on offense, and lost the series in six games. However, Bradley's sixth NBA season was both an individual and team success, capped off when he was included in the NBA All-Defensive First Team. Bradley and the Celtics both continued to improve in 2016–17. Beginning with an opening night 17-point performance that included 3 of 4 three-point shooting, Bradley enjoyed his most effective offensive season, although injuries limited him to just 55 games. Starting every game he played, Bradley was remarkably consistent, with double digit scoring in 50 of his 55 regular season contests. At his best, he was an outstanding weapon from three-point range. In the Celtics' third game of the season, for instance, Bradley scored 31 points on a career-high eight three-pointers, also managing 11 rebounds, as the Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets. Bradley's season scoring average of 16.3 points per game was a career high, while his 39.0 three-point percentage was his best since 2013–14. His rebounding totals, meanwhile, saw a dramatic leap, as he averaged 6.1 for the season, nearly double what he ever had before. Bradley managed double digit rebounds on ten different occasions, including November 16, when he recorded a career-high 13, to go along with 18 points, in a win over the Dallas Mavericks. Unfortunately, Bradley struggled through several injuries, most notably a right Achilles injury that cost him 22 out of 23 games during a stretch in January and February. The season was a success for the Celtics, with 53 wins earning them the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. However, in the first round of the postseason, the Celtics initially struggled and fell behind the eighth-seeded Chicago Bulls 2–0. When they managed to win the series in six games, it marked Bradley and the team's first postseason series win since 2012. Bradley scored 24 and 23 points in Games 5 and 6, with the 24 points a playoff career high. Bradley topped that in the next round, with 29 points against the Washington Wizards in Game 5 to help the Celtics take a 3–2 lead in the series, which they ultimately won in seven games. The Celtics' Eastern Conference Finals opponent, the Cleveland Cavaliers, ultimately proved to be too much. In an otherwise one-sided series, the high point for the Celtics came courtesy of Bradley. Playing Game 3 down two games to none and without the injured Isaiah Thomas, Boston stayed unexpectedly close to the Cavaliers throughout the game, then won when Bradley's 3-pointer bounced around the rim and fell with less than a second left. Bradley finished the game with 20 points. The Celtics lost both the fourth and fifth games, bowing out of the playoffs. On July 7, 2017, in a bid to clear enough cap space to sign star free agent Gordon Hayward, as well as an attempt to increase the size of their perimeter defenders, the Celtics traded Bradley and a 2019 second-round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Marcus Morris. Bradley had been the longest tenured Celtic on the team at the time. In his debut for the Pistons in their season opener on October 18, 2017, Bradley scored 15 points in a 102–90 win over the Charlotte Hornets. On November 15, 2017, he scored a season-high 28 points in a 99–95 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Bradley missed seven games with a hip-groin injury between late December and early January. On January 29, 2018, Bradley, along with Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanović, a future protected first-round draft pick and a future second-round draft pick, was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Blake Griffin, Willie Reed and Brice Johnson. On March 13, 2018, he underwent successful surgery to repair adductor and rectus abdominis muscles. He was subsequently ruled out for six to eight weeks. On July 9, 2018, Bradley re-signed with the Clippers. On February 7, 2019, Bradley was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple. On February 12, Bradley led Memphis with a career-high 33 points in a 108–107 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. On July 6, 2019, Bradley was waived by the Grizzlies. On July 8, 2019, Bradley signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although he has a build more typical of a point guard, Bradley plays shooting guard. Making up for his lack of size at the position with quickness, strength and tenacity, Bradley excels at defense. Opponents Damian Lillard and C. J. McCollum have called him the best perimeter defender in the NBA. Bradley has outstanding athleticism and explosiveness, having won the Slam Dunk Contest at the 2009 McDonald's All-American Game. However, he rarely displays his elite leaping ability in games, occasionally blocking players at the rim or throwing down dunks but more often simply harassing his man on the perimeter and settling for layups. Bradley has nevertheless become an increasingly valuable offensive player, especially as a reliable three-point shooter. Bradley's intense and frenetic defensive style of play, probably his most valuable asset, may also be partly to blame for the series of injuries he has suffered in his career. However, his most serious injuries, which required three surgeries by the time he was 23, happened early in his career. Due to his defense and his offensive improvement, Bradley became an increasingly important member of the Celtics, and his minutes played per game steadily increased over his time with the team, from just 5.2 to 33.4. Bradley has a son, Avery Bradley III, who was born just two weeks after Bradley's mother died, in September 2013. He began hosting a basketball camp, the Avery Bradley Skills Academy, for Boston-area children in the summer of 2014.",26137,446,2019-20,39.0,34.0,911.0,5.4,11.7,0.459,1.7,4.7,0.37,3.6,7.0,0.52,0.6,0.8,0.8,0.7,2.8,3.4,1.8,1.2,0.1,1.5,3.6,13.1,14.0,Los Angeles Lakers

There is only one exception: whenever he's a costumed character, he wears a red baseball cap on top of his head most of the time, rather than just wearing a white one during baseball seasons in comic strips and animation. The character's creator, Charles M. Schulz, said of the character that "" must be the one who suffers because he is a caricature of the average person. Most of us are much more acquainted with losing than winning."" Despite this, Charlie Brown does not always suffer, as he has experienced some happy moments and victories through the years, and he has sometimes uncharacteristically shown self-assertiveness despite his frequent nervousness. Schulz also said: ""I like to have Charlie Brown eventually be the focal point of almost every story.""Charlie Brown is the only Peanuts character to have been a part of the strip throughout its 50-year run. Lee Mendelson, producer of the majority of the Peanuts television specials, has said of Charlie Brown that ""He was, and is, the ultimate survivor in overcoming bulliness—Lucy or otherwise.""Charlie Brown's birth date is October 30.He is four years old in a strip originally published Nov. 3, 1950, putting his birth in 1946 and making him and his cohort part of the first wave of Baby Boomers.He ages very slowly in the strip's floating timeline, eventually settling at around eight years old. A strip published on April 3, 1971 suggests he was born around 1963 (setting up the gag that when he is 21, it will be 1984).Initially Charlie Brown suggests he lives in an apartment with his grandmother occupying the one above his; a few years into the strip, he moves to a house with a back yard.His name was first used on May 30, 1948, in an early Schulz comic strip called Lil’ Folks in which one boy has buried another in a sandbox and then denies that he has seen the other boy (""Charlie Brown"") when asked. He made his official debut in the first Peanuts comic strip on October 2, 1950. The strip features Charlie Brown walking by, as two other children named Shermy and Patty look at him. Shermy refers to him as ""Good Ol' Charlie Brown"" as he passes by, but then immediately reveals his hatred toward him once he is gone on the last panel. During the strip's early years, Charlie Brown was much more playful than he is known for, as he often played pranks and jokes on the other characters. On December 21 of the same year, his signature zig-zag pattern appeared on his formerly plain T-shirt. By April 25, 1952, his shirt changed to a polo shirt with a collar and the zig-zag.On the March 6, 1951, strip, Charlie Brown first appears to play baseball, as he was warming up before telling Shermy that they can start the game; however, he was the catcher, not yet the pitcher.Charlie Brown's relationships with other Peanuts characters initially differed significantly from their later states, and their concepts were grown up through this decade until they reached their more established forms. An example is his relationship with Violet Gray, to whom he was introduced on the February 7, 1951, strip. The two constantly remained on fairly good terms; a bit different from their now-known relationship. Charlie Brown often fed on Violet's mud pies. On the August 16, 1951, strip, she called Charlie Brown a ""blockhead"", being the first time Charlie Brown was referred by that insult. November 14 of that year, Charlie Brown is first unable to kick a football, and Violet is responsible because fear of her hand being kicked by Charlie Brown resulted in her letting go of it. Charlie Brown is introduced to Schroeder on May 30, 1951. As Schroeder is still a baby, Charlie Brown cannot converse with him. On June 1 of the same year, Charlie Brown stated that he felt like a father to Schroeder; in fact, for quite some time, he sometimes acted like a father to him, trying to teach him words and reading stories to him, and on September 24 of that year, he taught Schroeder how to play the piano, thus allowing Schroeder to become the prodigy he is known by Peanuts readers. Then on that year's October 10, he told Schroeder the story of Beethoven and set the piano player's obsession with the composer. Charlie Brown placed the Beethoven bust on Schroeder's piano on November 26, 1951. Schroeder aged rapidly over time, catching up to Charlie Brown in age, and Charlie Brown became less like a father figure and more like a close friend to Schroeder. Charlie Brown had Schroeder become his catcher for the first time on the April 12, 1952, strip. Around this point, their final relationship has pretty much been established. On January 6, 1952, Charlie Brown made his appearance on the first Sunday Peanuts strip. Charlie Brown is first seen interacting with the character Lucy van Pelt on March 3, 1952. He was on better terms with her than later in the strip, as they often made fun of each other out of mere playfulness. The November 16, 1952, strip is the first strip in which Charlie Brown was prevented by Lucy from kicking a football; on this strip she pulls it away because she fears that Charlie Brown will get her new football dirty, and then on the same strip, she holds it too tightly, so Charlie Brown is unable to kick it for a second time. Charlie Brown first began flying a kite on April 25, 1952, strip. Charlie Brown is first seen with Linus on the September 19, 1952, strip. Charlie Brown was unable to talk to him because he was introduced as an infant. Similar to Schroeder, Linus caught up to Charlie Brown in age and settled as being slightly younger than him, and on January 18, 1956, Linus befriended Charlie Brown, and eventually he would become Charlie Brown's best friend, and their current relationship was established. On September 1, 1958, Charlie Brown's father was formally revealed to be a barber (after earlier instances in the strip that linked Charlie Brown to barbers by implication.) In early 1959, Charlie Brown (and other Peanuts characters) made his first animated appearances after they were sponsored by the Ford Motor Company in commercials for its automobiles, as well as for intros to The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show. The ads were animated by Bill Meléndez for Playhouse Pictures, a cartoon studio that had Ford as a client. In the 1960s, the Peanuts comic strip entered its Golden Age, and Charlie Brown reached heights higher than ever before, becoming known in numerous countries, with the strip reaching a peak of 355 million readers. In 1960, the now-popular line of Charlie Brown greeting cards was introduced by Hallmark Cards. While the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show ended in 1961, the deal between Charles Schulz and the Ford Motor Company lasted another three years. Schulz and animator Bill Meléndez became friends, and when producer Lee Mendelson decided to make a two-minute animated sequence for a TV documentary called A Boy Named Charlie Brown in 1963, he brought on Meléndez for the project. Before the documentary was completed, Coca-Cola asked Mendelson if he had a Christmas television special. He said ""yes."" The next day he called Schulz and said they were making a Christmas special featuring Charlie Brown and the Peanuts characters, in which he collaborated with both Schulz and Melendez. Titled A Charlie Brown Christmas, it was first aired on the CBS network on December 9, 1965. The special's primary goal is showing ""the true meaning of Christmas"". Before its broadcast, the people involved in the special's creation were worried that it might be a project blow, with its unorthodox soundtrack and explicit religious message. It was, however, a huge success, with the number of homes watching the special an estimated 15,490,000, placing it at number two in the ratings, behind Bonanza on NBC.; in other words, almost half of the people who were watching television were watching the special. It also received unanimous critical acclaim, and had a large legacy: according to author Charles Solomon, it established the half-hour animated special as a television tradition, inspiring the creation of numerous others, including How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1966) and Frosty the Snowman, and served as an inspiration for dozens of young aspiring artists and animators, many of whom went on to work within both the comics and animation industries, among them Eric Goldberg (Pocahontas), Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., Up), Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, WALL-E), Jef Mallett (Frazz), and Patrick McDonnell (Mutts). The special's score made an equally pervasive impact on viewers who would later perform jazz, among them David Benoit and George Winston. The special was honored with both an Emmy and Peabody Award. The success of A Charlie Brown Christmas is followed by the creation of a second television special starring Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown's All-Stars, which was originally aired on June 8, 1966. Later that year, Charlie Brown made his appearance in a third Peanuts special: the Halloween-themed It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. For the rest of the decade, three television specials starring Charlie Brown (You're in Love, Charlie Brown; He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown; It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown) were created. The stage adaptation of a concept album titled You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, based on Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, and Patty, went into rehearsal in New York City on February 10, 1967. Prior to its opening, the musical had no actual libretto; it was several vignettes with dialog based on the Peanuts strips and a musical number for each one. Since Patty was such a weakly defined character in Schulz's strip, she became a composite character in the musical, with much of her material taken from Violet and Frieda in the strip. On March 7, 1967, the musical premiered off-Broadway at Theatre 80 in the East Village, featuring Gary Burghoff as Charlie Brown. On December 4, 1969, Charlie Brown starred on the first full-length animated feature based on Peanuts: A Boy Named Charlie Brown. The film was a box office success, gaining 6 million dollars in the box office out of its 1 million dollar budget, and was well received by critics. Charlie Brown and his dog Snoopy reached new heights on May 18, 1969, they became the names of the command module and lunar module, respectively, for Apollo 10 While not included in the official mission logo, Charlie Brown and Snoopy became semi-official mascots for the mission. Charles Schulz drew an original picture of Charlie Brown in a spacesuit; this drawing was hidden aboard the craft to be found by the astronauts once they were in orbit (its current location is on a display at the Kennedy Space Center). For this decade, the character appeared on twelve Peanuts television specials that were produced as a result of the success of the prior ones. Charlie Brown also appeared on two full-length animations (namely Snoopy, Come Home and Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown, and released respectively on August 9, 1972, and August 24, 1977). A Broadway production of You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown opened at the John Golden Theatre on June 1, 1971, and closed on June 27, 1971, after 32 performances and 15 previews, featuring Dean Stolber as Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown went on to feature in fourteen more television specials, two of which are musicals (one of which is the animated version of You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown). Charlie Brown starred once again on a full-length animation, which was titled Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!), and was released on May 30, 1980. Six television specials featuring Charlie Brown were produced during this decade. Within the comic strip, a storyline got Charlie Brown the character Peggy Jean as a girlfriend; this relationship lasted for roughly nine years. Charlie Brown made his final comic strip appearance on the final original Peanuts strip, which was published on February 13, 2000—the day after Schulz's death. The strip began with Charlie Brown answering the phone with someone on the end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responded with ""No, I think he's writing."" The bottom panel consisted of the final daily strip in its entirety, reprinted in color, and included various Peanuts characters surrounding it. The very last panel consisted simply of Snoopy sitting at his typewriter in thought with a note from Schulz that read as follows: Fittingly, Charlie Brown was the only character to appear in both the first strip in 1950 and the last in 2000. After the comic strip ended, Charlie Brown continued to appear in more television specials. On November 20, 2006, the special He's a Bully, Charlie Brown beat a Madonna concert special with its 10 million views, although Peanuts was no longer in its heyday. As of 2016, the latest of Charlie Brown's original television appearances is Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown, which came out on October 1, 2011. A computer-animated film starring Charlie Brown, The Peanuts Movie was released on November 6, 2015, in order to introduce Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang to a new generation. The film was directed by Steve Martino, produced by Blue Sky Studios, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The director said of the character: ""We've all been Charlie Brown at one point in our lives"" The film received largely positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and grossed $246 million worldwide against its $99 million budget, making it a box office success. Martino said: Charlie Brown's traits and the events he underwent are inspired by those of Schulz, who admitted in interviews that he'd often felt shy and withdrawn in his life. In an interview with Charlie Rose in May 1997, Schulz observed: ""I suppose there's a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists, because cartooning, like all other humor, comes from bad things happening."" Furthermore, both Charlie Brown's and Schulz's fathers were barbers and their mothers housewives. Charlie Brown's friends, such as Linus and Shermy, were named after good friends of Schulz, and Peppermint Patty was inspired by Patricia Swanson, one of Schulz's cousins on his mother's side. Schulz devised the character's name when he saw peppermint candies in his house. Even Charlie Brown's unrequited love for the Little Red-Haired Girl was inspired by Schulz's own love for Donna Mae Johnson, an Art Instruction Inc. accountant; When Schulz finally proposed to her in June 1950, shortly after he'd made his first contract with his syndicate, she turned him down and married another man. Charlie Brown is a meek, kind, innocent, gentle-hearted character with many anxieties, and is depicted as being shy. He is a child possessed with significant determination and hope but often fails due to his insecurities. Charlie Brown is always referred to by his full name (with the exception of Peppermint Patty who calls him ""Chuck"", and Marcie and Eudora who call him 'Charles') and his usual catchphrase is ""good grief"". Like Schulz, Charlie Brown is the son of a barber. The character is an example of ""the great American un-success story"" in that he fails in almost everything he does with an almost continuous streak of bad luck; but still keeps trying with large efforts and work, resulting either in more losses or great victories. Some of these victories are hitting a game-winning home run off a pitch by a minor character named Royanne on a strip from 1993, and his victory over Joe Agate (another minor character) in a game of marbles on a strip from 1995. Although Charlie Brown is often unlucky within the strip's storylines, in some ways Charles M. Schulz created through the ever-persevering character ""the most shining example of the American success story in the comic strip field.""  Charlie Brown is generally generous: for instance, on one strip where Lucy took all of his caramels when he lets her get one, he easily forgives her and offers her the sack he was carrying the caramels in. Charlie Brown cares very deeply for his family and friends, even if he was maltreated by them. His care for his sister is shown on a strip from May 26, 1959 (the strip in which his little sister Sally was born), when he exclaims: ""A BABY SISTER?! I'M A FATHER! I mean my DAD's a father! I'M a brother! I have a baby sister! I'M a brother!"" at her birth, and two strips later threw a celebration over it by handing over chocolate cigars to his friends. When Charlie Brown was maltreated by his companions (most often Lucy, Violet and Patty), he does not usually take out his anger on them, but often retaliates and even manages to turn the tables. An example is a strip from 1951, which features Violet and Patty telling Charlie Brown that they are not going to invite him to their party, with Charlie Brown replying that he does not wish to go their ""dumb ol' party"" anyway, leading the two girls to invite him. Charlie Brown is also notable for being a budding cartoonist, creating his own comic strips; he would show these strips to the other characters. Being an admirer of comics, he also owns his own comic book collection; he has a taste for comic books like ""Revolutionary War Comics"", ""Civil War Comics"", and ""World War I Comics"". Christopher Caldwell has stated that ""What makes Charlie Brown such a rich character is that he's not purely a loser. The self-loathing that causes him so much anguish is decidedly not self-effacement. Charlie Brown is optimistic enough to think he can earn a sense of self-worth, and his willingness to do so by exposing himself to humiliations is the dramatic engine that drives the strip. The greatest of Charlie Brown's virtues is his resilience, which is to say his courage. Charlie Brown is ambitious. He manages the baseball team. He's the pitcher, not a scrub. He may be a loser, but he's, strangely, a leader at the same time. This makes his mood swings truly bipolar in their magnificence: he vacillates not between kinda happy and kinda unhappy, but between being a ""hero"" and being a ""goat"".""Another characteristic of the character is his never getting a chance to kick a football, with one of the themes that recurred in the strip involving Charlie Brown attempting to kick a football before the ever-sadistic Lucy pulls it away to make him feel miserable and powerless. The two often talk, as Charlie Brown, being smart and knowing what she will do, often initially rejects the offer, but then appears to ultimately succumb to desperation and tries to kick the football. The humor of the strips with this theme, however, are not primarily slapstick but rely on the circumstances surrounding the event. Furthermore, no two of such strips have the same formula, as Schulz varied them significantly. Since 1952, this theme was featured once every year, usually during the autumn season (the years 1984, 1985 and 1990 did not feature this gag.) The first iteration of this theme appeared on November 14, 1951. In this instance, the ball holder was Violet who didn't pull the ball away but let go out of fear of having her hands kicked with the familiar result of Charlie Brown missing the kick and falling flat on his back. This has sometimes been parodied in pop culture, especially in satires, frequently involving Charlie Brown kicking Lucy instead of the football, or other people hurting Lucy out of pity for Charlie Brown. Only on one occasion, Charlie Brown is able to kick the football during the special, It's Magic, Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown is invisible because of Snoopy (Who is under the name the Great Houndini). Therefore, Lucy was not able to see Charlie Brown and he ends up taunting her in the beginning. In the end, Snoopy figures out a solution and sprays it on Charlie Brown. Lucy is now able to see Charlie Brown and the gag occurs. Charlie Brown is the manager and pitcher of a baseball team which frequently loses. His entire team is not skilled, especially his right fielder Lucy van Pelt, who is the worst baseball player in the entire Peanuts universe. Charlie Brown's dog Snoopy, who is his shortstop, is purported to be his best player, his best friend Linus was his second baseman, and his next closest friend Schroeder, his catcher, once commanded the team on Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!) when Charlie Brown, Linus, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, Snoopy and Woodstock traveled to France. Charlie Brown is often hit by a line drive back through the box on the same ball he pitched, resulting in him being stripped of all his clothes with the exception of his shorts, a literal example of being ""undressed"" by a hard hit ball. Despite the fact that his team almost always loses, usually with no runs scored, he remained determined and acted as an ambitious commander of a team of players who often appeared to be uncooperative; aside from this, none of the other players seem to share his determination. His apparent admirable strength as a leader was shown in his scoldings and advice to his players; an example of his strict attitude was shown when he yelled at Lucy ""Go back to right field where you belong!"" when she continued to annoy him. While the team frequently loses, it has some wins. While terrible misfortune has placed some of Charlie Brown's team's wins when Charlie Brown is not playing, there are times in which Charlie Brown has heroically led his team to a championship although it never wins any of them. Charlie Brown frequently becomes involved in love. His general love interest was dubbed ""The Little Red-Haired Girl"", as he didn't know her name and had never even talked to her. Charlie Brown liked to watch the little Red-Haired girl but hid from her sight because he is too shy to let her see him. She was usually not shown, being outside the panel, and her only actual appearance was silhouetted. Charlie Brown did fall in love with Peggy Jean, a girl first featured in the July 23, 1990 strip. Most of the other girls call him ""wishy-washy""; however, the characters Peppermint Patty and Marcie were both infatuated towards him. Peppermint Patty believed wishfully that Charlie Brown liked her, though Charlie Brown considered her as only a friend. Her wishful thinking shows when she asks Charlie Brown on a Sunday Strip: ""You kind of like me, don't you, Chuck?""; her saying on another Sunday strip that Charlie Brown ""doesn't even understand who he likes""; her sending a Valentine to Charlie Brown that said: ""I know you like me."" Marcie, on the other hand, was usually too shy to admit her feelings. Another one of Charlie Brown's characteristics is his inability to fly a kite. Almost every attempt to fly a kite resulted in failure, usually due to his nemesis, the Kite-Eating Tree and his lack of skills was often commented on by other characters, most often Lucy. On the March 7–8, 1958 strips, Charlie Brown got his kite to fly into the air, but it spontaneously combusted, making his victory worthless. During Halloween, like other kids, Charlie Brown went trick-or-treating along with most of his friends. During this holiday, he always wore a ghost costume by making two oval holes on a white blanket to give the impression of a ghost with two hollow eyes. Sometimes, Charlie Brown wore this costume after Halloween, usually due to a screw-up, like his laundry coming in late. Charlie Brown got rocks whenever he goes trick-or-treating, resulting in depression, but he remained hoping that he will get a chance to receive candy on the next year's Halloween. When the special It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown was first aired in 1966, the viewers sympathized so much with Charlie Brown that they sent Halloween candy to the studio in order to show their sympathy towards him. Charlie Brown's best friend, Linus frequently got him to wait in a local pumpkin patch in order to see Linus's mythological being, ""The Great Pumpkin"". Charlie Brown was always shown trying to convince Linus that The Great Pumpkin didn't exist, but Linus was always shown to hope that The Great Pumpkin will arise from a ""sincere"" pumpkin patch and bless him with toys, making Charlie Brown's efforts in vain. On Valentine's Day, Charlie Brown was frequently shown waiting at his mail box to get a Valentine from a girl, but, in almost every case, Charlie Brown doesn't receive any, though on the special Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown, he received a Valentine from Violet out of pity, and he accepts it, even though Schroeder (Charlie Brown's best friend after Linus) scolded Violet for trying to appease her and her female companions' guilty conscience. The special's viewers, similar to the viewers of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, sent Valentine's Day cards to the studio out of sympathy. On the first Peanuts television special, Charlie Brown sought to know the true meaning of Christmas, as even though the jolly season was approaching, he was still depressed. It involved him directing a Christmas play with his uncooperative companions, and eventually, Linus told him the meaning that he had always wanted to know. ""For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ, the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God, and saying, 'Glory to God in the Highest, and on Earth peace, and good will toward men.' That’s what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown."" Charlie Brown began in an early strip (November 3, 1950) that he was ""only four years old"", but he aged over the next two decades, being six years old as of November 17, 1957, and ""eight-and-a-half years old"" by July 11, 1979. Later references continue to peg Charlie Brown as being approximately eight years old. Another early strip, on October 30, 1950, has Patty and Shermy wishing Charlie Brown a happy birthday on that day, although they are not sure they have the date right. However, Charlie Brown, like the other Peanuts children, was not strictly defined by his literal age, as creator Charles M. Schulz distinguished the Peanuts characters by ""fusing adult ideas with a world of small children."" ""Were they children or adults? Or some kind of hybrid?"" wrote David Michaelis of Time magazine. Michaelis continues: In other words, Charlie Brown and the other human Peanuts characters transcended age and were more broadly human. Charlie Brown takes care of Snoopy; while he is puzzled and sometimes frustrated by some of Snoopy's activities (often lamenting, ""Why can't I have a normal dog like everybody else?""), Charlie Brown nonetheless does his best to provide his dog with a happy life. Snoopy is always there for him when he gets let down or needs support, even if it's just a drink of water. The two most frequently interact during Snoopy's suppertime, when Charlie Brown comes out of the house and presents his dog with a bowl of food after which, Snoopy often breaks into a dance (once causing Charlie Brown to lament, ""Why do I feel like I'm feeding Fred Astaire?""). Snoopy, however, refers to Charlie Brown as ""the Round-Headed Kid."" While Charlie Brown and Lucy often do not get along well, they still usually talk to each other. Charlie Brown primarily dislikes Lucy for her abrasive, loud-mouthed personality and her insane ideas, and Lucy calls Charlie Brown names (especially ""blockhead"") whenever she verbalizes her disdain for him. Lucy constantly bullies him and scolds him about how much he is a failure. Charlie Brown frequently tries to tell Lucy that her crazy theories are false, and when he finally succeeds, Lucy would make an insensitive remark about the way he looks. Charlie Brown's stomach hurts when Lucy tries to teach her theories to Linus. Charlie Brown often visits Lucy's psychiatric booth for help, but always gets useless advice (such as ""Snap out of it."" or ""The insecurities people have can lead to colds and other illnesses""). Linus is Charlie Brown's best friend. Linus is sympathetic towards Charlie Brown and often gives him advice after listening to Charlie Brown's various insecurities. Similarly, Charlie Brown, who is older and more mature, generally acts as an overseer to Linus's faults, such as his undying faith in the Great Pumpkin, his dependence on his security blanket, or any of his other odd quirks. They are also together in an allegiance over a common enemy: Lucy, who harasses and bullies Charlie Brown as much as she does Linus. Charlie Brown and Linus are often seen having discussions while sitting on a street curb or leaning up against the brick wall. At some point in the strip, Linus begins to appear sitting behind Charlie Brown in school, despite being younger than Charlie Brown. During winter, they often play a game of building snow forts from which they throw snowballs at each other. Charlie Brown's best friend after Linus is Schroeder, and Charlie Brown is also one of the few people Schroeder will allow to lounge on his piano, as he and Charlie Brown are good friends, and knows that Charlie Brown respects his love of Beethoven. In fact, when they were younger, Charlie Brown would read Schroeder the story about Beethoven's life. Charlie Brown was also the one that introduced Schroeder to the piano. For the most part, Charlie Brown and Schroeder were friends, with the exception of one argument from the mid-1950s (when the two had more of a rivalry going) where Charlie Brown insulted his ""yellow hair"" and ""plink, plink, plink all day long [on his piano]"" and Schroeder countered with a barb at Charlie's coonskin cap and ""round head."" Charlie Brown has Schroeder to serve as his catcher and, during conferences on the pitcher's mound, the two would engage in unusual conversations, mostly about Beethoven and hand signals (one finger means..., two fingers means..., etc.). Charlie Brown received Schroeder's most significant act of friendship in Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown. When Violet offers Charlie Brown one of her used Valentine cards (since Charlie received no Valentines the prior day at his school's party), Schroeder thoroughly chastises her, Frieda, Lucy and Sally for their disregard for his feelings and their selfish motive of relieving their own personal guilt. Charlie Brown, however, tells the girls not to listen to him and accepts the card, although he expressed appreciation for Schroeder's gesture. Peppermint Patty is perhaps Charlie Brown's closest female friend. Charlie Brown and Peppermint Patty lead baseball teams which often play against each other. Peppermint Patty is infatuated with Charlie Brown, who, while being a close friend, probably has no romantic interest in her, even though he doesn't say anything to hurt her feelings. Peppermint Patty refers to him as ""Chuck"". Charlie Brown is often brought by Peppermint Patty into lover's games, but does not take the bait; he does like Peppermint Patty, but only as a friend (though their friendship is occasionally strained by her strong personality and bossiness toward him). Originally, Peppermint Patty played reverse psychology; she would often say, ""You kind of like me, don't you, Chuck?"" when it was clear that it was Peppermint Patty who had the crush on Charlie Brown, while he not only did not have a crush on her, he also did not quite know what to make of her. Charlie Brown is often conversed with by Peppermint Patty about matters of the heart (often depicted with both characters sitting under a tree) and even often receives phone calls from her (with Peppermint Patty usually taking up the majority of the conversation), and Charlie Brown usually evades the issue, often by simply pretending to be dumb. Marcie is infatuated with Charlie Brown and they are good friends and while she is usually too shy, she has occasionally managed to confess to him. Marcie often asks Charlie Brown if he likes her. As he does with Peppermint Patty, Charlie Brown often responds to Marcie's inquiries by trying to evade the issue, though it seems as if Charlie has feelings for her, which more than once has made Marcie so angry that she kicked him in the shins out of frustration. Marcie often calls him ""Charles"". Charlie Brown is often the straight man in stories focusing on his sister, frequently bothered by his younger sister Sally, who often complains about different sorts of things. He is often forced to do her homework, and he either willingly agrees or scolds her for it. They are rather kind to each other, but Charlie Brown is frequently disrespected by Sally. He has also occasionally firmly put his foot down on any of her truly unacceptable behavior, such as lying about taking a crayon from school or reading his letters. Charlie Brown is always on good terms with the strip's sole African-American character and a good friend to him. Franklin is arguably the nicest person in the strip to Charlie Brown, and the two occasionally build sand castles, go to Charlie Brown's house, and watch movies together. Frieda was usually nicer to Charlie Brown than most of the other girls in the neighborhood, which makes them good friends. Unlike Lucy, Patty, and Violet, she seemed to be mindful of his feelings and never teased him or put him down to his face (except for rare moments in the Peanuts specials), though she did get mad at him a few times. She eventually joined Charlie Brown's baseball team as an outfielder but refused to wear a baseball cap because it would hide her naturally curly hair. She seemed to be one of the few characters that Charlie Brown felt confident enough to stand up to, as he did once when she was badgering Snoopy about chasing rabbits and he told her to mind her own business. Charlie Brown is the only Peanuts character to unconditionally accept ""Pig-Pen"" for who he is, even defending ""Pig-Pen's"" uncleanliness in one strip (which was re-used in A Charlie Brown Christmas and the Peanuts (TV series) ): Rerun has come to admire Charlie Brown, often calling him ""the master"". Rerun looks up to Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown became his mentor and friend. Charlie Brown is often teased by Violet Gray by bragging about how her dad has more possessions than Charlie Brown's, and he has occasionally been able to deflate her. He often tries to befriend her, only to get turned down. Patty, having one of the weakest individual personalities of the Peanuts cast, usually takes part in mocking Charlie Brown when her friends Lucy and Violet, or others, do so. Charlie Brown and Shermy were enemies in the first Peanuts strip. Eventually, the two became close friends before Linus and Schroeder eventually filled those roles and Shermy faded out of importance. Charlie Brown had a notably surprisingly successful romantic relationship with Peggy Jean, although she eventually broke up with him when he realized that she already had a boyfriend.

He co-founded Brown University. Brown was the son of James Brown II and Hope Power Brown and grew up in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the grandson of Baptist minister James Brown (1666–1732), and his father was a prosperous merchant. The family firm was active in distilling rum, owned an iron furnace, and took part in a wide variety of merchant activities including sponsoring the ill-fated and notorious voyage of the slave ship Sally in 1764.Moses Brown's father died in 1739, and Moses was raised in the family of his uncle Obadiah Brown, who was primarily responsible for running the firm's spermaceti works. Following Obadiah's death in 1762, Moses served as executor of his estate. Shares in the farming and shipping business were divided between Moses and his three brothers, Nicholas, Joseph, and John, and the business was renamed as Nicholas Brown & Co. The brothers were co-founders of the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, later renamed Brown University after Nicholas's son. The family was active in the Baptist community of Providence and were descendants of Chad Brown (c. 1600 – 1650), a Baptist minister who co-founded Providence with Roger Williams. Moses had a sister, Mary. Brown's brother-in-law and business partner, Jabez Bowen was a notable Rhode Island political figure. Moses Brown eventually differentiated himself from his family by converting to Quakerism. A chest of drawers belonging to Brown currently resides in a Private Collection. it was likely made in Providence, Rhode Island.Moses Brown married his cousin Anna Brown (daughter of his uncle Obadiah) in 1764. They had two surviving children: Sarah (1764–1794, married William Almy) and Obadiah (1771–1822), as well as a daughter who died young. Moses also served as a deputy to the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1764 to 1771, and he served on a committee to oppose the Stamp Act in 1765. In 1769, he participated in efforts to move the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations to Providence from Warren, Rhode Island. The four Brown brothers donated family land passed down from Chad Brown for the new campus. Brown's wife Anna died in 1773. He gradually retired from the family business and began his involvement with Quaker meetings. The following year, under the influence of his children's tutor, Job Scott, he formally became a member of the Society of Friends. Following their brother John Brown's arrest in with the Gaspee affair that helped trigger the American Revolutionary War, Moses and Joseph Brown delivered to the English in Boston a proposal that Rhode Island's preparations to resist royal authority be stopped if John Brown was released.In 1779, Brown married his second wife, Mary Olney, a fellow Quaker. They were married for 18 years, and had no children. In 1788, Brown returned briefly to the business world, embarking on a textile venture in partnership with his cousin Smith Brown and his future son-in-law William Almy. Moses Brown became interested in recent British attempts to use water power in their textile mills, and hired English emigrant Samuel Slater to help build a similar mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1790, the factory became the first water-powered spinning mill in America, a seminal event generally considered the birth of the American Industrial Revolution. Moses' son Obadiah Brown soon replaced Smith Brown as a partner, and Samuel Slater was taken in as well, to create the new firm of Almy, Brown & Slater. Moses Brown soon withdrew from active involvement in the firm, but remained a partner. After getting Almy, Brown & Slater off the ground, Moses Brown moved on to a variety of new activities. He played a role in Rhode Island's ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1790. He also became interested in agricultural experiments on his Providence farm, and helped found the Rhode Island Agricultural Society in 1800. He served on the first board of directors of the Providence Bank, and was treasurer of the Central Bridge Company. Along with his son Obadiah, he was a founder of the Rhode Island Bible Society. During the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, he was a strong advocate of sanitation practices. He later introduced smallpox vaccination to Rhode Island. Brown's second wife Mary died in 1798, and he married his third and final wife, the widow Phebe (Waterman) Lockwood, in 1799. She had several grown children of her own: Sarah (1773–1832, married E. Bates Harris), Avis (1774–1831, never married), Benoni (1777–1852) and Phebe (1778–1800). After the death of his third wife in 1809, Moses remained unmarried for the last 27 years of his life. Brown was inspired by the War of 1812 to work on behalf of peace, and was instrumental in the founding of the Rhode Island Peace Society in 1818. He adhered to and promoted the orthodox Quaker position that Quakers should resist war taxes.Another one of his interests was local history. Brown played an important role in collecting documents relating to colonial Rhode Island, many of them inherited through his own family. He collected biographical information about his contemporary and fellow abolitionist, the evangelist known as the Public Universal Friend.He was a founding member of the Rhode Island Historical Society, served as its chairman, and had most of his papers left there after his death. Brown was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.Moses Brown left few family members, having outlived three wives, all three of his children, and three of his four step-children. At his death, his only descendants were his granddaughter Anna (Almy) Jenkins (1790–1849) and her children. He also left much of his estate to the children of his stepdaughter Sarah (Lockwood) Harris (1773–1832), and to the Society of Friends. His son Obadiah had married, but left no children. Brown is buried in the Quaker section of the North Burial Ground at 5 Branch Avenue, Providence, RI. Following the financial failure and human tragedy of his and his brothers' role in the slave trade, Moses broke with his brothers and refused to continue his business sponsorship of it. Later, after becoming a Quaker, he began a long crusade against slavery, and soon became Rhode Island's leading opponent of the slave trade. In 1773, nine years after the voyage of the Sally, he freed the last of his own slaves.During the war, he solidified his opposition to slavery in the company of ministers and teachers from the College, which had ceased business temporarily because British troops were billeted in its campus. At the end of hostilities, Brown renewed his efforts against the slave trade. He unsuccessfully petitioned the General Assembly in 1783, wrote frequently in the local press, and helped distribute antislavery pamphlets throughout New England. He was instrumental in the 1787 passage of a law banning the participation of Rhode Islanders in the slave trade. In 1789, he helped found the Providence Society for Abolishing the Slave Trade with both Quaker and non-Quaker associates to help enforce recently passed anti-slave trade legislation. He later helped engineer passage of a law in the U.S. Congress to forbid foreign slave ships from being equipped in American ports. He also became known for his willingness to help slaves and free blacks on an individual basis, through financial and legal assistance. In contrast, his brother John was one of the state's leading slave traders and the first person prosecuted under the federal laws prohibiting slave importation. One of his last great contributions to Rhode Island life was his role in the revival of the New England Yearly Meeting School. It had existed intermittently in the 1770s and 1780s, but died out through lack of interest. In 1814, Brown presented the Yearly Meeting with 43 acres of land in Providence, and worked diligently toward the creation of a school on this land. He provided important financial assistance, and also donated his impressive book collection to the school library. His son Obadiah joined him as a major supporter of this effort until his untimely death in 1822. Moses Brown served as the school's treasurer until shortly before his own death in 1836, at the age of 98. The school was renamed in his honor in 1913 as the Moses Brown School, and remains a leading preparatory school in the U.S.",26150,541,2019-20,9.0,0.0,33.0,4.4,10.9,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.4,10.9,0.4,3.3,8.7,0.375,3.3,12.0,15.3,1.1,1.1,1.1,3.3,7.6,12.0,25.0,Portland Trail Blazers

He finished fourth in the 2014 Illinois Mr. Basketball voting. In April 2014, Illinois, Purdue, Kansas and Villanova had in-home visits. On May 3, 2014, he announced the eight schools that he was considering playing college basketball for: UConn, Michigan State, Illinois, Kansas, Purdue, Villanova, Michigan and Temple. That summer he was the number one rated point guard according to ESPN,although the class had a notable shortage of elite pure point guards. On June 25—the day after Jalen won a gold medal at the 2014 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship—Rick Brunson received an offer as an on-bench assistant coach from Temple. The Temple offer fell through when Rick Brunson was arrested on various charges on July 25, and Temple fell out of the running for Jalen's services.

At the time of his decision, he was ranked as the number one point guard in the national class of 2015 by Scout.com. Stevenson was a preseason top-10 team in the MaxPreps national high school rankings. A lot was expected of Brunson's team after losing to teams led by Parker and Okafor in the IHSA tournament final four in 2013 and 2014 even though no team from Lake County has ever won a state basketball championship. The team rattled off 11 straight victories to start the season before losing 88–81 to Chaminade Prep and its star Jayson Tatum in the Cancer Research Classic in Wheeling, WV, despite 48 points from Brunson. On January 17, Brunson and Stevenson faced Derryck Thornton, Jr. and Findlay Prep at the Hoophall Classic. At the time, Brunson was the number 3 ranked point guard in the class of 2015 and Thornton was the number 2 ranked point guard in the class of 2016 for the number 1 team in the country according to USA Today. Findlay, who was led by Arizona signee Allonzo Trier's 27 points, held Brunson to 26 in the second loss of the season for Stevenson, who had been 15–1. On January 28, he was named to the 2015 McDonald's All-American Boys Game roster, becoming the second player from Lake County to earn such recognition.

Brunson was 9-for-15 from the field and 9-for-9 from the free throw line. 2015 was Lake county's ninth consecutive year with a team reaching the IHSA final four; Stevenson became the first school in the large school division and the third school overall to win IHSA football and basketball state championships in the same year. The win got him out of the shadow of IHSA final four losses to Parker- and Okafor-led teams.

He is 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) tall and plays both shooting guard and small forward but occasionally has played power forward during the latter part of his career. Carter is the only player in NBA history to play 22 seasons; the only player to play in four different decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s);and, at 43 years old, he is the oldest active NBA player, and the last one that was born in the 1970s. Carter is widely regarded as one of the greatest dunkers of all time.A high school McDonald's All-American, Carter played college basketball for three years with the North Carolina Tar Heels and twice advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament. He was selected with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, who traded him to the Toronto Raptors. Carter emerged as a star in Toronto. He won the 1999 NBA Rookie of the Year Award and won the Slam Dunk Contest at the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend. That summer, he represented the United States in the Summer Olympics, winning a gold medal. He entertained crowds with his leaping ability and slam dunks, earning nicknames such as ""Vinsanity"", ""Air Canada"", and ""Half-Man, Half-Amazing"". In December 2004, Carter was traded to the New Jersey Nets, where he continued to put up big numbers. Carter has also played for the Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings, and Atlanta Hawks. He received the Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award in 2016. Carter is an eight-time NBA All-Star. Off the court, Carter established the Embassy of Hope Foundation, assisting children and their families in Florida, New Jersey, and Ontario. He was also recognized in 2000 as Child Advocate of the Year by the Children's Home Society, and he received the Florida Governor's Points of Light award in 2007 for his philanthropy in his home state. Born in Daytona Beach, Florida, Carter attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach. He played football as a quarterback until a broken wrist in his freshman year forced him to pick up volleyball instead.In volleyball, he was named the Volusia County Player of the Year as a junior and averaged 24 kills per match; for comparison, none of his teammates averaged more than one.Carter was also offered a saxophone scholarship to attend Bethune–Cookman. He led Mainland's basketball team to its first Class 6A state title in 56 years and was a 1995 McDonald's All-American. Carter was contacted by 77 NCAA Division I schools but ultimately chose North Carolina over Florida.Carter attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, spending three seasons playing college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels under Dean Smith and later, Bill Guthridge. During the 1997–98 season, he was a member of new coach Guthridge's ""Six Starters"" system that featured Antawn Jamison, Shammond Williams, Ed Cota, Ademola Okulaja, and Makhtar N'Diaye. During his sophomore and junior seasons, Carter helped North Carolina to consecutive ACC Men's Basketball Tournament titles and Final Four appearances. He finished the 1997–98 season with a 15.6 points per game average and was named second-team All-American, First-Team All-ACC, and to the fan's guide third-annual Coaches ACC All-Defensive Team. In May 1998, Carter declared for the 1998 NBA draft, following his classmate Jamison, who had declared earlier that spring. During his NBA career, Carter continued his coursework at North Carolina, and in August 2000, he graduated with a degree in African-American studies. On January 31, 2012, Carter was honored as one of the 35 greatest McDonald's All-Americans, and on February 23, 2012, President Barack Obama, an avid basketball fan, gave praise to Carter at a fundraiser event, referring to Carter's game as a ""huge treat for me ever since he's been playing for the Tar Heels."" Carter was initially drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft. He was then traded to the Toronto Raptors for the fourth overall pick, Antawn Jamison—Carter's college teammate and good friend. The Raptors had struggled in their first three years as a franchise. Carter was instrumental in leading the Raptors to their first-ever playoff appearance in 2000 before going on to lead them to a 47-win season and their first ever playoff series win in 2001, advancing them to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Due to the NBA lockout, Carter's rookie season did not start until January 1999. Carter quickly became a fan favorite with a soaring offensive game that earned him the nickname ""Air Canada"". He won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 18.3 points and throwing down countless highlight-reel dunks. Carter ascended to full-fledged stardom in his second season – he averaged 25.7 points per game (fourth-highest in the league) and lifted Toronto to its first playoff appearance in franchise history. He subsequently earned his first NBA All-Star selection and was named to the All-NBA Third Team. During the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend, Carter showcased arguably the most memorable Slam Dunk Contest event in its history. He won the contest by performing an array of dunks including a 360° windmill, a between the legs bounce dunk, and an ""elbow in the rim"" dunk (also known as a ""cookie jar"" dunk or the ""honey dip""). Carter and his distant cousin Tracy McGrady formed a formidable one-two punch as teammates in Toronto between 1998 and 2000. However, McGrady was dealt with the Orlando Magic in August 2000, leaving Carter as the Raptors' franchise player. It is believed by some that the Raptors could have won championships if McGrady and Carter stayed together in Toronto. In 2000–01, his third season, Carter averaged a career-high 27.6 points per game, made the All-NBA Second Team, and was voted in as a starter for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game. The Raptors also finished the regular season with a then franchise-record 47 wins. In the playoffs, the Raptors beat the New York Knicks 3–2 in the first round, and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals to face off against the Philadelphia 76ers. Carter and Allen Iverson played in a seven-game series that see-sawed back and forth. Carter scored 50 points in Game 3 and set an NBA playoff record for most three-point field goals made in one game. Television ratings for Game 7 soared as one of the highest watched in NBC's history for a non-finals game. As the Sixers and Raptors increased their double team pressures on Carter and Iverson respectively, the game winning shot came down to Carter who missed with 2.0 seconds remaining. Iverson said of the series in July 2011: ""It was incredible. (Carter) had great games at home and I had some great games at home, but both of us were just trying to put our teams on our back and win basketball games. It is great just having those memories and being a part of something like that."" In August 2001, Carter signed a six-year contract extension worth as much as $94 million. However, Carter began showing the effects of what would become career-altering problems with his knees in the wake of his big contract. He earned a reputation as a fragile player after suffering a series of knee and hamstring injuries. Carter missed the final 22 games of the 2001–02 regular season due to injury. He started in 60 games and averaged 24.7 points per game. On December 7, 2001, Carter recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 steals against the Denver Nuggets. He joined Charles Barkley (1988) as the only two players to have ever posted a game with 40 points, 15 rebounds, five steals and five assists, dating back to the 1973–74 season, when the league officially began tracking steals. He was voted into the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, but he could not participate due to injury. Without Carter during the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Raptors were defeated in five games by the Detroit Pistons in the first round. Following off-season surgery, Carter only managed 43 games during the 2002–03 season. In February 2003, Carter gave up his starting spot in the 2003 NBA All-Star Game to Michael Jordan to allow Jordan to make his final start as an All-Star. Carter played in 73 games during the 2003–04 season, but the Raptors fell three games short of making the playoffs. During the 2004 off-season, general manager Glen Grunwald and the entire coaching staff were fired following the team's failure to reach the playoffs. Carter became frustrated with the Raptors' upper management. In particular, Carter was unhappy with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE) and Raptors president Richard Peddie. In a private meeting, Peddie reassured Carter that MLSE was serious in building a contender in Toronto and that he would pursue established players like point guard Steve Nash and center Jamaal Magloire. Carter was also given the impression that Peddie would consider Julius Erving as a serious candidate for general manager; however, it was later disclosed that Erving was never really in the mix. Peddie instead hired Rob Babcock as general manager, whose first priority in rebuilding the Raptors was to ""establish our philosophy"", stating ""we are not really worried about how many wins we get right away, or whether we make the playoffs within the first year or two."" He then hired Sam Mitchell as head coach. Consequently, much speculation arose whether Carter wanted to be traded. The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt misled and felt the Raptors would never be an elite team under the current MLSE structure with Peddie as Raptors president. Some fans raised money to fly a ""Keep Vince, Trade Peddie"" banner over the Air Canada Centre just before Carter's annual charity game. When Rob Babcock was questioned about the trade speculations, he denied Carter asked for a trade but indiscreetly revealed Carter's agent had approached him for a trade request. During the 2004–05 season, Mitchell often benched Carter in the fourth quarter to emphasize the new team philosophy he and Babcock wanted players to adapt to, spurring rumors of fights between Carter and Mitchell and new point guard Rafer Alston. Carter's trade wish was finally granted on December 17, 2004, when he was dealt to the New Jersey Nets for Alonzo Mourning, Aaron Williams, Eric Williams and two first round draft picks. In his first game back in Toronto, on April 15, 2005, Carter was heavily booed and jeered by Raptors fans; some fans were found burning Vince Carter jerseys, while many donned No. 15 baby bibs, 'FUVC' T-shirts, and other merchandise that labelled Carter as ""Wince"" or as ""immature"", alluding to Carter's knee and ankle injuries and his dissent. Much like former Raptors teammate Tracy McGrady, Carter received such treatment for years to come in the town that once embraced him. In a January 2005 interview, TNT analyst John Thompson asked Carter if he had pushed himself as hard as he should have in Toronto. Carter replied, ""In years past, no. I was fortunate to have the talent ... you get spoiled when you're able to do a lot of things. You see that you don't have to work at it. Now, with the all the injuries, I have to work harder. I'm a little hungrier. Getting a fresh start has made me want to attack the basket."" Though Carter's comments were perceived by Raptors fans as a confession that he had not played his hardest while on the Raptors, Thompson said the comments were misinterpreted: ""That boy never said to me, 'Coach, I just laid down and quit.' ...I was embarrassed and felt awful about it for his sake, because I knew what he was communicating to me... he was more expressing a desire of wanting to do better, as we all do."" Despite Thompson's defense of Carter, the Toronto Star's Dave Feschuk in 2007 wrote that Carter ""cheated on (the Raptors). He quit on the floor."" Carter later stated his comments were misconstrued. On the eve of the Raptors–Nets playoff series in 2007, Carter told New York's WFAN radio station, ""One day, maybe the fans will understand how it all went down. That's all I can say."" In November 2011, Carter, along with his cousin Tracy McGrady and Charles Oakley, addressed the Toronto audience in an interview on Off the Record with Michael Landsberg. When asked about being booed in Toronto, Carter said, ""They watched myself and Tracy grow up. And when we left they still got to see (us) flourish and become (who we are). For me, I looked at it as, a young child growing up into a grown man and moving on. And I get it. Leaving, hurt a lot of people. It hurt me because I tell you what... I accomplished a lot, I learned a lot, I became the person and player of who I am today because of that experience, through the coaches, players, and everything else. I get it... but regardless I still love the city. I have friends there and my heart is still there because that's where it all started."" Later in the interview, when asked about any words to the Toronto fans, Carter said, ""I appreciate the fans and whether you cheer for me, boo me, or hate me, I still love you. Toronto's one of the best kept secrets.. puts one of the best products on the floor and one of the top places to play in."" On November 6, 2012, in an interview with TSN Radio 1050, Carter reiterated his love for the city and his appreciation for the Toronto Raptors organization. The next day, Sam Mitchell and Rob Babcock revealed on Sportsnet 590, The Fan that the night before Carter was traded to New Jersey, Carter phoned Mitchell to express his desire to stay in Toronto and commit to their vision for the team. However, Babcock said it was too late and the trade had already been verbally agreed upon. Looking back on it, Mitchell feels he should have personally contacted the MLSE chairman, Larry Tanenbaum, but was reluctant because he did not want to break the chain of command. Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri referred to Carter in April 2014 as ""one of the symbols of the Toronto Raptors."" To this day, Carter remains the Raptors' all-time leader in points per game with 23.4, having amassed 9,420 points during his ​6 1⁄2-year run in Toronto. On November 19, 2014, nearly a decade after the trade, as a part of the Raptors' 20th anniversary celebration, the team paid tribute to Carter with a video montage during the first quarter of the Raptors-Grizzlies game. Leading up to the game, questions were raised about how Raptors fans would receive the planned video tribute. As the sellout crowd watched the video tribute featuring highlights of Carter's high-flying Raptors days, what began as the usual booing turned into an overwhelmingly positive standing ovation. An emotional Carter used his warm-up shirt to wipe tears running down his face as he pointed to his heart and waved to the fans in appreciation. He later stated, ""It was a great feeling, I couldn't write it any better."" Carter was acquired by the New Jersey Nets on December 17, 2004, playing five seasons for them before departing in June 2009. Carter produced some of his highest numbers with the Nets, surpassing his 23.4 points per game with the Raptors to average 23.6 points per game over his tenure in New Jersey. He missed just 11 games in his four full seasons and helped lead the Nets to three straight playoff runs between 2005 and 2007. Carter joined a Nets team with Jason Kidd and Richard Jefferson as the leading players. However, the trio never got to play together at full strength during the 2004–05 season. Carter and Kidd carried a shallow roster on a 15–4 run to end the season to make the playoffs. In the 2005–06 season, the Carter-Kidd duo co-led the Nets to 49 wins, an Atlantic Division title, and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs. Carter helped lead the Nets to the second round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual NBA champions Miami Heat in five games. Carter averaged 29.6 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists in 11 playoff games. Carter was named an Eastern Conference All-Star in 2006. On November 7, 2005, Carter threw down a very memorable dunk against the Miami Heat, over defensive stalwart, Alonzo Mourning. On December 23, 2005, Carter set an NBA record for the most free throws made in a quarter (4th quarter) with 16 against Miami. He tied his career high of 51 points in the same game. In the 2006–07 season, Carter was named as a reserve to the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, marking his eighth All-Star appearance. In a 120–114 overtime win over the Washington Wizards on April 7, 2007, Carter and Kidd became the first teammates in over 18 years to record triple-doubles in the same game since the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen achieved this feat against the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989. Carter finished with 46 points, a career-high 16 rebounds, and 10 assists. Kidd finished with 10 points, tied a career high with 16 rebounds, and tied a season high with 18 assists. Carter finished the 2006–07 season playing all 82 games, averaging over 25 points with a 21 PER. In July 2007, Carter re-signed with the Nets to a four-year, $61.8 million contract. During the 2007–08 season, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks. Carter was credited for becoming a leader following the All-Star break. He became captain of the Nets, and in 2008–09, he and teammate Devin Harris were the highest-scoring starting backcourt in the league. On November 21, 2008, Carter scored a season-high 39 points, including a game winning two-handed reverse dunk, as the Nets battled back from an 18-point deficit to defeat the Toronto Raptors 129–127 in overtime at the Air Canada Centre. He hit a 29-foot, game tying three-pointer to send the game into overtime and then scored the winning basket in the extra period. On February 3, 2009, Carter recorded his fifth career triple-double with 15 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 99–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On June 25, 2009, Carter was traded, along with Ryan Anderson, to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Rafer Alston, Tony Battie and Courtney Lee. Orlando hoped Carter would provide center Dwight Howard with a perimeter scorer who can create his own shot—something the Magic had lacked when they were defeated in the 2009 NBA Finals by the Los Angeles Lakers. On February 8, 2010, Carter had a season-high 48 points, 34 in the second half, when the Magic rallied from a 17-point deficit to defeat the New Orleans Hornets 123–117. Carter helped the Magic reach the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics. To date, this is the only time Carter has played in a conference finals series. On December 18, 2010, Carter was acquired by the Phoenix Suns in a six-player trade with the Magic. On January 17, 2011, Carter recorded 29 points and 12 rebounds in a 129–121 win over the New York Knicks. He reached 20,000 career points during the game, becoming the 37th NBA player to reach that plateau. On December 9, 2011, following the conclusion of the NBA lockout, Carter was waived by the Suns, meaning the team only had to pay him $4 million of the $18 million he was due for the 2011–12 season. Carter appeared in 51 games with 41 starts while averaging 13.5 points while shooting 42 percent. On December 12, 2011, Carter signed a three-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks. This move reunited Carter with former Nets teammate Jason Kidd. On April 20, 2012 against the Golden State Warriors, Carter became the eighth player in NBA history with 1,500 3-pointers when he made one in the closing minutes. While known early on in his career for his circus dunks, Carter became known for his 3-point shooting with the Mavericks. On February 13, 2013, in a 123–100 win over the Sacramento Kings, Carter scored 26 points to pass Larry Bird on the NBA's career scoring list, moving him into 29th place. Carter turned aside a Sacramento rally in the third quarter by going 5 of 7 from long range and scoring 17 of Dallas' last 21 points in the period. He ended the night with 21,796 career points for 29th on the all-time list, five ahead of Bird. He also became the 11th NBA player with at least 1,600 3-pointers. He finished the season ranked 27th on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 22,223 career points. His 162 3-pointers tied his career high for 3s made in a season (162-of-397, .408, with Toronto in 2000–01). Over the course of the season, he advanced from 17th place to 11th place on the NBA's all-time 3-point field goals made list (passing Nick Van Exel, Tim Hardaway, Eddie Jones, Glen Rice, Jason Richardson and Kobe Bryant), finishing the year with 1,663 career 3-pointers. Prior to the 2013–14 season, Carter established himself as the Mavericks' sixth man, after the departure of Jason Terry. He averaged just 10.5 points and shot 37.6% from the field during the first 22 games of the season due to increased responsibilities and pressure to be the team's lone scoring punch off of the bench. He saw his numbers improve in December, averaging 12.5 points and shooting 44.3% from the field during an 18-game stretch. On March 16, 2014 against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Carter raised his career total to 23,010 points, becoming the 27th NBA player to pass the 23,000-point mark with a 3-pointer with 2:17 left in the third quarter. In Game 3 of the Mavericks' first round playoff series against the San Antonio Spurs, Carter drilled the game-winning 3-pointer with no time remaining on the clock to give the eighth-seeded Mavericks a 109–108 win and a 2–1 series edge over the top-seeded Spurs. The Mavericks went on to lose the series in seven games. On July 12, 2014, Carter signed a multi-year deal with the Memphis Grizzlies. On November 13, 2014, he made a game winning alley-oop assist from the sideline to teammate Courtney Lee at the buzzer to win the game 111–110 over the Sacramento Kings. On December 17, 2014, Carter scored a season-high 18 points in a 117–116 triple overtime win over the San Antonio Spurs. Carter moved into 25th in all-time NBA scoring during the game, passing Robert Parish (23,334). Carter appeared in just one of the Grizzlies' first 12 games of the 2015–16 season. On February 24, 2016, with nine points scored against the Los Angeles Lakers, Carter passed Charles Barkley (23,757) for 24th in career points scored. Two days later, he scored a season-high 19 points in a 112–95 win over the Lakers. For the latter half of April and the whole first round playoff series against the Spurs, Carter was inserted in the starting lineup and played well. In Game 1 against the Spurs, Carter scored a team-high 16 points in a 106–74 loss. The Grizzlies went on to lose the series in four games. After finishing second behind Tim Duncan in the 2014–15 season, Carter was awarded with the Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award for the 2015–16 season. The award recognizes the player deemed the best teammate based on selfless play, on- and off-court leadership as a mentor and role model to other NBA players, and commitment and dedication to team. On November 1, 2016, Carter played in his 1,278th NBA game, tying him with A. C. Green for 25th on the NBA's career list. He also became the 24th player in NBA history to surpass 24,000 career points. On November 8, he scored 20 points against the Denver Nuggets and became the oldest player in the NBA to post a 20-point game since Michael Jordan scored 25 for the Washington Wizards in April 2003, at age 40. It was also Carter's first 20-point game since April 30, 2014. On November 12, Carter made seven field goals against the Milwaukee Bucks to pass Gary Payton (8,708) for 21st in NBA history. Carter also passed Charles Oakley for 24th on the NBA's career games played list with 1,283. On November 14, in a win over the Utah Jazz, Carter had his second 20-point game of the season, joining Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing as the only players in NBA history to put up 20 points and 5+ rebounds off the bench at the age of 39, with Carter being the oldest at 39 years and 287 days. Carter missed seven games in early December with a right hip flexor strain. On January 11, Carter hit his 1,989th career three-pointer to move ahead of Jason Kidd and into fifth on the all-time list.

Only Robert Parish (42 years and 65 days old) was an older opening-night NBA starter than Carter. On November 21, he scored 14 points off the bench in a 124–108 loss to the Toronto Raptors, thus becoming the 22nd player in NBA history to reach 25,000 career points.

He and Samaki Walker tied for the team lead in blocks in the team's eight games. During the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Carter performed one of the most memorable dunks of his career when he jumped over 7-foot-2-inch (2.18 m) French center Frédéric Weis. Teammate Jason Kidd said ""It was one of the best plays I've ever seen."" The French media later dubbed it ""le dunk de la mort"" (""the Dunk of Death""). The U.S. team went on to win the gold medal that year and Carter led the team with 14.8 points per game. Carter admitted he channeled his frustrations in his personal life and Tracy McGrady leaving the Raptors before the Olympics. Carter replaced Kobe Bryant on the USA roster for the 2003 FIBA Americas Tournament while Bryant was undergoing surgeries on his knee and shoulder. He wore Bryant's jersey number 8. Bryant was supposed to take his spot back in time for the 2004 Olympics. However, Bryant later on withdrew due to the rape charges he was facing at that time. Carter was offered the Olympic spot but declined as he felt he needed to take some time off during the summer to rest and heal and he was also getting married at that time. Carter is the only player in NBA history to appear in a game in four different decades. He is one of six players in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assists per game in 10 straight seasons.

The season began about how Carter-Williams envisioned with him coming off the bench but solidly in Jim Boeheim's rotation. That niche role gradually eroded, however, as Jardine and Triche solidified their starting roles and Waiters emerged as the best sixth man in the nation. It was a difficult first season for him in which he did not play in 11 games and received sporadic minutes in others.He finished the season averaging 2.7 points, 2.1 rebounds and 10.3 minutes in 26 total games (no starts).During the 2012 offseason, Carter-Williams worked on his game, from lifting weights daily and drinking protein shakes to try to get stronger, to doing shooting drills every morning and improving his nutrition. His hard work over the offseason translated into Carter-Williams' emergence as a breakout star for Syracuse and one of the best point guards in the nation during the 2012–13 season.He went on to start his first game for Syracuse in the season opener and kept his starting role for the entire season, starting all 40 games.

As a result, on February 18, the trade was rescinded and Chandler was sent back to the Hornets. Chandler appeared in just 45 games during the 2008–09 season, missing 29 of the team's final 44 games due to left ankle injuries. Chandler finished the 2008–09 season as the franchise's all-time leader in field goal percentage (.611) and rebounds per game (11.3), while ranking fifth in total rebounds despite playing just 197 career games with the team (2,225). On July 28, 2009, Chandler was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for Emeka Okafor. In his lone season with the Bobcats, Chandler played in 51 games (starting 27) and averaged 6.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.1 blocks despite being hampered by a stress reaction in his left foot that caused him to miss 29 games. On July 13, 2010, Chandler was traded, along with Alexis Ajinça, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Erick Dampier, Eduardo Nájera, Matt Carroll and cash considerations. Chandler was the perfect fit during his first season with the Mavericks, anchoring their defense on a team with Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Terry and Jason Kidd. He was credited with giving the Mavericks the 'toughness' and defensive intensity that they sorely lacked, earning selection to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for his efforts. He helped them reach the 2011 NBA Finals, where they faced the Miami Heat. In Game 4 against the Heat, with Nowitzki under the weather and ailing backup center Brendan Haywood unable to stay in the game, Chandler had 13 points and 16 rebounds in an 86–83 win that tied the series at 2–2. He grabbed nine offensive boards, with eight coming after the first quarter. The Mavericks went on to defeat the Heat in six games, with Chandler winning his first and so far only championship. Following the 2010–11 season, Chandler was tipped to be a highly sought-after free agent. He was heavily courted by the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets among other teams. While they were keen to retain him, the Mavericks were cautious not to overextend on Chandler and risk missing out on Dwight Howard or Deron Williams in 2012. As a result, they offered only a two-year deal to Chandler, which he declined. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban infamously broke-up the championship-winning team, choosing to add Lamar Odom, Vince Carter and Delonte West instead of bringing back Chandler, J. J. Barea and DeShawn Stevenson. At the time, Cuban chose to proceed cautiously in the era of a new collective bargaining agreement, believing that financial flexibility (and not locking in veterans to long-term deals that would eat up future cap space) was more valuable than trying to repeat as champions. In August 2016, Chandler noted that if the Mavericks had not broken up the 2011 championship-winning team, they would have gone on to win back-to-back titles in 2012. On December 10, 2011, Chandler was acquired by the New York Knicks via sign-and-trade as part of a three-team trade, joining the Knicks on a reported four-year, $58 million contract. With Chandler anchoring the middle, New York's defense improved markedly in 2011–12. After finishing 22nd in defensive efficiency in 2010–11, the Knicks finished fifth in defensive efficiency in 2011–12. Chandler finished the season with a league-leading 67.9 field-goal percentage, the third highest in league history at the time behind only Wilt Chamberlain with 72.7 in 1972–73 and 68.3 in 1966–67. In May 2012, he was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and earned NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors. He became the first player in franchise history to win Defensive Player of the Year, and joined Alvin Robertson (1986) and Dikembe Mutombo (1995) as defensive players of the year on the Second All-Defensive Team. Due to a different voting system for All-Defensive, Oklahoma City's Serge Ibaka was the forward on the first team, while Orlando's Dwight Howard was the center. Additionally, Chandler was named to the All-NBA Third Team. In January 2013, Chandler was named an NBA All-Star for the first time in his 12-year career, earning selection as an Eastern Conference reserve for the 2013 NBA All-Star Game. In early February, he tied a franchise record with three straight 20-rebound games, becoming the first Knicks player to have 20 in three straight games since Willis Reed in December 1969. On February 27, he had 16 points and a career-best 28 rebounds in a 109–105 win over the Golden State Warriors. In May 2013, he was named in the NBA All-Defensive First Team, becoming the first Knicks player to earn first-team honors since Charles Oakley in 1994. Marred by injury early in the 2013–14 season, it took Chandler some time to get his rhythm back. A right knee injury suffered on November 5 against the Charlotte Bobcats and an upper respiratory illness endured in early January resulted in Chandler appearing in just 55 games. On June 25, 2014, Chandler was traded back to the Dallas Mavericks along with Raymond Felton in exchange for Shane Larkin, Wayne Ellington, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and two second round picks in the 2014 NBA draft. The move reunited Chandler with championship comrades Dirk Nowitzki and J. J. Barea, as well as coach Rick Carlisle. In 75 games during the 2014–15 season, Chandler averaged a double-double with 10.3 points on 66.6 percent shooting and 11.5 rebounds, in addition to 1.2 blocks. With his third season averaging a double-double while shooting at least 60 percent from the field, Chandler matched Wilt Chamberlain and joined Artis Gilmore as the only players in league history to accomplish this at least three times in their careers (DeAndre Jordan has since accomplished this feat). With a career field goal percentage of 59.1 percent at the end of the 2014–15 season, Chandler had the second-highest field goal percentage in NBA history among those with at least 2,000 makes, trailing only Gilmore. On July 9, 2015, Chandler signed a four-year, $52 million contract with the Phoenix Suns. On November 27, he suffered a strained right hamstring against the Golden State Warriors. He subsequently missed eight games. On January 21, Chandler grabbed a season-high 20 rebounds in a 117–89 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Two days later, in a 98–95 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Chandler tied a Suns record with 27 rebounds, including 17 in the first half, and also had 13 points and a season-high five assists. His 27 rebounds equaled the record total set by Paul Silas in 1971, and his 13 offensive boards set a franchise record. Chandler also became the first Suns player in franchise history to record consecutive 20-rebound games. On December 11, 2016, Chandler had 14 points and 21 rebounds in a 120–119 overtime loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. Two days later, he grabbed a season-best 23 rebounds in a 113–111 overtime win over the New York Knicks. With his third 20-rebound game of the season on January 3 in a 99–90 win over the Miami Heat, Chandler became the first Suns player with three-plus in a season since Charles Barkley (5) in 1993–94. On January 21, in a 107–105 win over the New York Knicks, Chandler set a team record by grabbing 15-plus rebounds in seven consecutive games. One night after setting the mark, Chandler ended his franchise record and career high of consecutive 15-plus rebound games at seven with nine rebounds against the Toronto Raptors. His best stretch of the season came between January 19–24, where he had three games of over 16 points (averaging 17.25) and over 16 rebounds (averaging 14.5), including scoring a season-high 22 points twice. Chandler appeared in 47 of the Suns' first 57 games before being deactivated following the All-Star break. Chandler reportedly told Suns management at the trade deadline he did not want to be dealt, and they acquiesced to his wishes. During the 2017–18 season, Chandler battled through a neck injury that sidelined him periodically for 36 total games. On January 14, 2018, Chandler grabbed 14 rebounds against the Indiana Pacers to become the 40th player in league history to reach 10,000 for his career. He played in just 46 games in 2017–18, including missing the final month of the season. After starting the 2018–19 season with a reduced role due to the arrival of rookie Deandre Ayton, Chandler and the Suns reached a buyout agreement on November 4, 2018. On November 6, 2018, Chandler signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. On July 19, 2019, Chandler signed with the Houston Rockets. Chandler was named first alternate on the United States national team which competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Chandler was a member of the United States team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, a team that finished 9–0 in the tournament and won the gold medal, the USA's first world championship since 1994. He played in all nine World Championship games as a backup center, averaged 2.6 ppg and 2.7 rpg, shot 64.3 percent from the field, and blocked five shots. Chandler was chosen to play for the United States team in the 2012 London Summer Olympics, and was named the team's starting center. The United States team finished undefeated in the tournament and won the gold medal over Spain with a 107–100 victory. Chandler played 9 minutes, and made 1 of 2 shots from the field. He ended the game with two points, which were the first points scored during the game. Until the age of 10, Chandler grew up with his grandfather on a farm in central California. His sister, Erica, played basketball at Pepperdine University. He has three brothers: Terrell, Tervon, and Ryan. His paternal grandmother is of German descent. Chandler is the son of Frank Chandler and the late Vernie Re Threadgill. Chandler and his wife Kimberly were married in 2005. They have three children. Chandler and his wife organized a charity to help New Orleans families who suffered from Hurricane Katrina. The charity helped purchase ""small things"" (as Chandler said) for the families' homes: TVs, stoves, microwaves, refrigerators, pots, pans etc. The wives of Chandler's teammates helped in the efforts. He was the subject of a limited edition 100 copy zine titled ""Tyson Chandler"". The zine was created in fall 2011 by Camilla Venturini and the photographer Ari Marcopoulos, and was the subject of a lengthy article in the Wall Street Journal. In 2016, Chandler joined UNICEF Kid Power as a UNICEF Kid Power Champion for a mission in Uganda, in an effort to fight global malnutrition and as well as raise awareness among kids, via the world's first ""wearable for good"".",26179,718,2019-20,26.0,5.0,219.0,2.3,3.0,0.778,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3,3.0,0.778,1.0,2.1,0.462,4.1,6.7,10.8,1.0,1.0,1.3,1.3,5.3,5.6,11.0,Houston Rockets

He has previously played for Zhejiang Guangsha of the Chinese Basketball Association during the 2011 NBA lockout and the NBA's New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets. He played college basketball at DePaul University for two years before declaring for the 2007 NBA draft, where he was a first-round selection of the Knicks. Chandler is listed at 6 ft 8 in. and 225 lbs. He can play both forward positions. Chandler has great leaping ability, finishes well at the basket, and an improving mid-range jumper.When growing up in Benton Harbor, Michigan, a three-hour drive from Detroit and two hours from Chicago, Chandler was raised by his grandparents.He started playing basketball at Fairplain East Elementary School in the Benton Harbor Area Schools when he was in fifth grade; he later attended Benton Harbor High School. There he received Michigan All-State mentions as a sophomore and junior; while averaging 22.4 points and 12 rebounds as a junior,he helped the BHHS Tigers to a 19–4 record. He was also named to the first team All-State by the Basketball Coaches Association of Michigan. As a senior, he averaged 24 points, 12 rebounds, five assists, and four blocks per game. That year, Chandler and the Tigers went undefeated during the regular season and were ranked #1 in the state. They were beaten by eventual state champion Holt High School in the regional final. Chandler was named Mr. Basketball of Michigan for 2005. Chandler was recruited by and considered Michigan State, Ohio State, Indiana University, Purdue University and the University of Dayton; however, he committed to DePaul University late in 2004. During his freshman season at DePaul, he achieved an average of 10.6 points and 7.2 rebounds (ranked 10th in the Big East) per game. On November 30, 2005, Chandler had his first breakout game, putting up 17 points, 8 rebounds and 4 blocks in a Blue Demons win over Creighton University. On December 10, 2005, he recorded 16 rebounds against Dayton, the most by a freshman since Quentin Richardson grabbed 16 in 1999. He earned Big East Rookie of the Week honors twice that season. He was also named to the Big East freshman team. Chandler scored 20 or more points 4 times, with a career-high of 26. During his sophomore season, he averaged 14.7 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks per game. As a sophomore, Chandler was named to the Big East all second team, and recorded eight double-doubles, while leading the team to a 20-win season. They made it to the quarterfinals of the NIT. He left the college tenth on DePaul's all-time list for blocked shots with 86.In April 2007, Chandler decided to enter his name in the 2007 NBA draft after careful consideration.Before entering the draft, he hired Chris Grier as his agent.He had not worked out for many teams prior to the draft.He was injured in Atlanta before being able to work out with any other teams. The Knicks talked to his agent and told him they were interested in him. Isiah Thomas, the team's general manager, had very good contacts at DePaul University and knew about him from watching him play in college.On June 28, 2007, Chandler was taken 23rd overall in the 2007 NBA draft by the Knicks. In his first game on November 13, 2007, he recorded 8 points, 2 rebounds and a steal. He had his best game on April 6, 2008, scoring 23 points vs. the Orlando Magic. He finished the season averaging 7.3 points per game. In the 2008–09 season under head coach Mike D'Antoni, Chandler saw his role with the Knicks expand. He finished the season averaging 14.4 points and 5.4 rebounds per game, while playing in all 82 games. Chandler had a breakout game against the Toronto Raptors, scoring 32 points on 12-23 shooting, including 6-10 from beyond the arc. Chandler participated in the 2009 Rookie Challenge, where he was tied for most rebounds on the sophomore squad. In 65 games in 2009–10, Chandler averaged 15.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.1 assists. On November 11, 2010 in a loss to the Golden State Warriors, Chandler had his front tooth inadvertently knocked out by former teammate David Lee. Chandler sat out for a few minutes before returning to the game to finish with 27 points and 3 blocks. On February 9, 2010 Chandler set a new career-high with 35 points against the Sacramento Kings, but the Knicks lost 118-114. Chandler assisted teammate Nate Robinson in the dunk contest during the All-Star Weekend. In the dunk, Nate Robinson used Chandler's back as a trampoline to dunk the basketball. During the season Chandler provided a clutch play down the stretch in a game against the Atlanta Hawks. Chandler had struggled all game but came up with a big block on a Josh Smith dunk attempt. The blocked shot was rebounded by Al Horford, who attempted a put-back but released the shot too late according to the referees. The Knicks once again finished the season with a poor record at 29-53, missing the playoffs. The Knicks made moves such as trading for Tracy McGrady in order to have cap space to make a big signing during the offseason and put talent around Chandler. The big signing ended up being Amar'e Stoudemire. Chandler scored 22 points in a season opening win for the new-look Knicks on October 27, 2010. On January 6, 2011, Knicks GM Donnie Walsh indicated his intentions to sign Chandler to a long-term deal. Chandler was enjoying his best season as a Knicks and embraced the new sixth man role coach Mike D'Antoni appointed him to. Chandler would come off the bench and play positions 2 to 4 on the floor. During the season Chandler also became one of the best shot-blocking wing players. Chandler's best game of the season was a 31-point effort against the San Antonio Spurs on January 4, 2011. The Spurs at the time were the NBA's best team and were easily defeated under Chandler's big game. On February 22, 2011, Chandler was traded to the Nuggets in a three-way blockbuster deal which also involved the Minnesota Timberwolves, and sent Carmelo Anthony to New York. Chandler immediately made an impact in his debut for the Nuggets, scoring 16 points, including 8 key fourth quarter points, in a victory over the Boston Celtics. In Denver, Chandler had to adapt to a more open offense. The Nuggets with the addition of him and teammates Danilo Gallinari and Raymond Felton had one of the deepest, most explosive teams in the NBA. The Nuggets ended up playing better without superstar Carmelo Anthony, clinching the fifth seed in the playoffs with a 50-32 record. On March 23, 2011 in a 115-112 win over the San Antonio Spurs, he played through a sprained ankle and finished the game with a remarkable 6 blocks. Though he finished with 8 points, he made a clutch jumper with 29.3 seconds left to give the Nuggets the lead for good, 114-112. Chandler made his first trip to the playoffs where the Nuggets would match up against the Oklahoma City Thunder, led by Kevin Durant. In his first playoff game Chandler scored 9 points to go along with 8 rebounds. Chandler struggled in the playoffs, averaging only 4.8 points and 5.0 rebounds in only 23 minutes a game. The Nuggets were defeated in five games. In August 2011, in the midst of an NBA lockout, Chandler signed with the Zhejiang Guangsha Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association. With Zhejiang Guangsha, he plays under former Dallas Mavericks head coach Jim Cleamons. About his decision, Chandler said, ""Maybe I'll lose out, but I think it can be a great experience. I haven't been in any  meetings. I can't call it. I'm just taking a risk, at the end of the day."" His deal didn't have an out-clause, which meant that Chandler wouldn't return until after the All-Star break. Had Chandler not signed with a Chinese team, he would have been a restricted free agent. Zhejiang Guangsha attempted to put more NBA talent around Chandler by signing Earl Clark, who asked to leave the team over family reasons. They later attempted to sign Tyson Chandler, but he declined the team's offer. In his debut, Chandler scored 43 points along with 22 rebounds and 4 assists in 50 minutes in a 118-115 double overtime win over Tianjin Ronggang. He followed his debut performance by recording 28 points, 12 rebounds and 2 assists against Qingdao DoubleStar in a 111-94 win. Chandler recorded 42 points, 10 rebounds and 3 steals in Zhejiang Guangsha's first loss against the Shandong Lions. With the help of Chandler, the Lions ended up reaching the playoffs to play against the Beijing Ducks in the first round. Unfortunately, he didn't participate in the playoffs, and as a result, Zhejiang was swept by Beijing. After Zhejiang was swept in the playoffs, Chandler was able to re-sign with the Nuggets, thus returning to the NBA. On March 18, 2012, Chandler signed a contract with the Denver Nuggets reportedly worth $37 million for 5 years. However, his season would then rapidly come to an end after playing only 8 games for the Nuggets, as he suffered a labral tear in his left hip and had to undergo surgery, which also made him unable to participate in the playoffs. On July 11, 2015, Chandler signed a multi-year contract extension with the Nuggets. On November 11, 2015, he was ruled out for the entire 2015–16 season after requiring surgery to repair a labral tear in his right hip. On March 7, 2017, Chandler scored a career-best 36 points in a 108–96 win over the Sacramento Kings. On July 6, 2018, Chandler and a future second-round draft pick were traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for cash considerations. He missed the first nine games of the 2018–19 season with a hamstring injury, making his debut on November 3 against the Detroit Pistons, going scoreless with four rebounds in 10 minutes. On February 6, 2019, Chandler was traded, along with Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet and a number of future draft picks, to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanović and Mike Scott. On July 8, 2019, Chandler signed with the Brooklyn Nets on a one-year, veteran minimum contract. On August 29, Chandler was suspended by the NBA for 25 games for use of performance-enhancing drugs (PED). He was flagged for Ipamorelin, a growth hormone that has been on the NBA's list of banned substances since 2016. During his treatment for a quadriceps injury sustained during the 2018-19 season, Chandler was given small doses of the drug by his personal physician. Chandler returned from his suspension and made his season debut with the Nets on December 15 in a 109–89 win against the Philadelphia 76ers.",26180,719,2019-20,26.0,0.0,549.0,4.0,9.4,0.427,1.8,5.8,0.315,2.2,3.5,0.611,1.2,1.4,0.857,0.6,7.1,7.7,2.0,1.0,0.5,1.8,3.8,11.0,3.0,Brooklyn Nets

As a youth growing up in Sacramento, California, Chriss played baseball and American football.Between fifth grade and eighth grade, he showed promise as a tight end, defensive end and safety. However, during a game in his eighth-grade season, Chriss landed awkwardly on his shoulder while attempting to catch a long pass and broke his collarbone.

As a freshman at Pleasant Grove, Chriss was one of 25 students who showed up for tryouts. The school only had junior varsity and varsity teams, which meant that roster spots were limited, especially for a player like Chriss who previously had zero competitive experience in the sport. Chriss almost didn't make it, but his energy and effort stood out. He began the season as a reserve before eventually working his way into the starting lineup. A year later, he started for the varsity team and led the school to a 28–6 record and a state championship. Colleges began offering Chriss scholarships that season, with the first coming from Northern Arizona University.In January 2014, he committed to the University of Washington.As a senior in 2014–15, Chriss averaged 21.9 points, 11.6 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game. Scout ranked him as the No. 55 recruit in the nation for the class of 2015 and Rivals ranked him as the No. 56 recruit, while ESPN and 247Sports.com both ranked him at No. 60.Chriss had a phenomenal start at Washington, recording a double-double with a season-high 29 points and 10 rebounds in the second game of the season against Mount St. Mary's. In the following weeks, however, his production dipped because he developed a habit of collecting unnecessary fouls. He fouled out of three straight non-conference games during the Battle 4 Atlantis in November 2015. His mother stepped in once again with a decision that likely saved his season in terms of productivity. She suggested Chriss consult a sports psychologist, and the Huskies accommodated her request. Chriss was forced to learn to play defense without fouling.He went on to have one of the top freshman campaigns in their program's history, finishing with the fourth-most points by a freshman (467), fifth-most rebounds (183), and the most blocks (55), the last of which being a freshman record there. His three-point shooting improved greatly as the season went on – he shot 6-for-26 (23.1 percent) from beyond the arc during the first 19 games of the season, and went 15-for-34 (44.1 percent) during the last 15 contests.He started all 34 games in 2015–16 and averaged 13.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game.He subsequently earned honorable mention Pac-12 All-Freshmen selection.On March 23, 2016, Chriss declared for the 2016 NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility.Throughout the draft process, Chriss went from being a considerable late-lottery or mid-first round talent to rising up in the draft as a potential top 3 draft candidate. In the days leading up to the draft, Chriss agreed to terms on a multi-year footwear and apparel endorsement deal with Nike. He ended up being selected with the eighth overall pick in the draft by the Sacramento Kings. Chriss was later traded to the Phoenix Suns on draft night for the draft rights to Bogdan Bogdanović and the rights of the 13th and 28th picks of the draft, Georgios Papagiannis and Skal Labissière. He became the first recruit outside of the top 50 rankings to be drafted in the top 10 as a one-and-done player since the rule was instituted in 2005. On July 7, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Suns and joined the team for the 2016 NBA Summer League. Chriss played in three games for the Suns during the Summer League before developing an illness that ruled him out for the rest of the tournament. Chriss made his debut for the Suns in their season opener on October 26, 2016 against the team that originally drafted him, the Sacramento Kings. In 22 minutes off the bench, he recorded seven points, four rebounds, two assists, and one block in a 113–94 loss. With Chriss playing alongside Devin Booker and fellow rookie Dragan Bender, the Suns became the first NBA team to have three teenagers on the floor in the same game. He made his first start for the Suns on November 8 against the Portland Trail Blazers, recording seven points, four rebounds, and one block in 20 minutes of play during the 124–121 loss. On December 13, he recorded his first career double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds in a 113–111 overtime win over the New York Knicks. On January 25, he was named in the U.S. Team for the 2017 Rising Stars Challenge. Five days later, Chriss had his first 20-point game in a 115–96 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. On February 2, 2017, he was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for games played in January, after averaging 8.3 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.4 steals for the month. Two days later, he scored a career-high 27 points in a 137–112 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 5, 2017, he had a career-best five blocked shots in a 109–106 win over the Boston Celtics. His five blocks were the most by a Suns rookie since Amar'e Stoudemire had six in November 2002. On March 15, 2017, he tied his career high of five blocks in a 107–101 loss to the Sacramento Kings. On April 1, 2017, he recorded 19 points and a career-high 13 rebounds in a 130–117 loss to Portland. As a rookie, Chriss played in all 82 games—the only Suns player to do so in 2016–17. At the season's end, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team, becoming the 14th player in franchise history to be named All-Rookie. In July 2017, Chriss re-joined the Suns for the 2017 NBA Summer League. In five games, Chriss averaged 14.4 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 1.0 blocks per game. On December 26, 2017, Chriss tied a career high with 13 rebounds in a 99–97 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. On January 12, 2018, Chriss missed the Suns' game against the Houston Rockets due to a hip injury, ending a streak of 124 consecutive games to begin his career. It was the longest streak by a Sun since Kyle Macy played in the first 329 games of his pro career from 1980–84. He returned to action on January 26 after missing six games, and was 1-for-12 from the field for three points in a 107–85 loss to the New York Knicks. On January 31, in a 102–88 win over the Dallas Mavericks, Chriss reached 100 career steals, three-pointers and blocks at 20 years, 213 days old. He became the third youngest player ever to reach 100 of each with only LeBron James and Kevin Durant doing so younger. On April 1, Chriss scored a season-high 22 points against the Golden State Warriors. He topped that mark on April 6 with 23 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. On August 31, 2018, Chriss was traded, alongside Brandon Knight, to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Ryan Anderson and De'Anthony Melton. On October 30, 2018, after missing the first five games of the season with a sprained left ankle, Chriss made his debut for the Rockets, recording four points and two rebounds in a 104–85 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. The Rockets declined the $4 million option for the 2019–20 season on Chriss' rookie contract, which would make him a free agent at the conclusion of the season. On February 7, 2019, Chriss was acquired by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team trade involving the Rockets and Sacramento Kings. On October 1, 2019, Chriss signed with the Golden State Warriors. He was waived by the Warriors on January 7, 2020, to make room for two-way contract player, Damion Lee, who was given a guaranteed contract for the remainder of the 2019–20 season. Chriss averaged 7.3 points and 5.4 rebounds per game, earning respect from teammates and coaches. The Warriors faced a hard cap that season that prevented them from keeping both Lee and Chriss. On January 15, the Warriors re-signed Chriss to a two-way contract. Chriss is the fourth-oldest of 9 brothers and sisters. He has three older and two younger sisters, and is the oldest of four brothers. His mother is Shawntae Wright, a licensed clinical social worker in Placer County, California. Chriss' stepdad, Michael Wright, had lived in Tacoma, Washington, and the visits to the Northwest were considered an influence to him going to the University of Washington.",26185,741,2019-20,51.0,13.0,977.0,6.2,11.6,0.535,0.3,1.3,0.229,5.9,10.4,0.573,3.6,4.8,0.76,3.5,7.1,10.6,3.2,1.2,2.0,2.4,3.6,16.4,10.0,Golden State Warriors

Clark (born May 1, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Washington Redskins (1985–92), Phoenix Cardinals (1993–94), and Miami Dolphins (1995). Clark attended and played high school football for the Cougars football team at Pulaski County High School in Dublin, Virginia. Clark played college football at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, where he caught 155 passes for 2,863 yards and 16 touchdowns. He also had three punt returns for touchdowns, including 89- and 87-yard returns in a game during the 1983 season against the University of Virginia. Clark was at James Madison during the Dukes' first four Division I-AA seasons. He caught 46 passes for James Madison's 8-3 team in 1982 and had 57 receptions in 1983. He was the Virginia offensive player of the year in 1982 and an honorable mention All-American in 1982 and 1983. Clark became the first person in James Madison history to have his jersey retired. Clark as selected by the Jacksonville Bulls sixth overall in the 1984 USFL Draft. He played for the Bulls in 1984 and 1985. Clark was selected by the Washington Redskins in the second round of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players. In 1985, he signed with the Redskins and had a superb rookie season, recording 72 receptions for 926 yards and five touchdowns. Clark quickly established himself as one of the top receivers in the NFL. He followed up his superb rookie season in 1986 with a Pro Bowl year catching 74 passes for 1,265 yards and seven touchdowns. Clark set a Redskin record for receiving yards in a game during a Monday Night Football contest with the New York Giants. He caught 11 passes for 241 yards and a touchdown. The record still stands today as the ""most receiving yards in a non-strike game"" (Anthony Allen surpassed Clark's tally during the 1987 strike season). The Redskins went on to finish with a 12-4 record and defeated the reigning Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears, 27-13, in a divisional playoff game but lost to the Giants in the NFC Championship game, 17-0. In 1987, Clark again had a Pro Bowl year, catching 56 passes for 1,066 and seven touchdowns. He achieved these numbers in only 12 games, as a player strike shortened the season by one game and replacements played three games. No Redskin player crossed the picket line and the replacements went 3-0. Clark was only one of four NFL receivers to surpass 1,000 yards. By this time, he had caught the eye of CBS commentator John Madden. Clark's toughness, big-play ability and willingness to block made him a regular on the All Madden Team during his playing career. The Redskins went on to finish 11-4, winning the NFC East crown. In the playoffs, the Redskins defeated the Chicago Bears in the Divisional Playoff game for the second year in a row, 21-17. Clark caught three passes for 57 yards and a touchdown in the NFC Championship game against the Minnesota Vikings. The Redskins won, 17-10, to earn the right to play in Super Bowl XXII. Clark caught three passes for 55 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 25 yards in Washington's 42-10 rout of John Elway and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXII. Clark's numbers dropped in 1988 as he caught 59 passes for 892 yards and seven touchdowns. The Redskins finished a paltry 7-9 and missed the playoffs. He returned to form in 1989, catching 79 passes (a career-high) for 1,229 yards and nine touchdowns. The Redskins finished 10-6 but missed the playoffs again because of a 5-6 start. Clark, along with fellow receivers Art Monk and Ricky Sanders, surpassed the 1,000 yard mark in 1989. This was the second time in NFL History that three receivers from one team all went over the 1,000 yard mark in the same year. In 1990, Clark had another Pro Bowl year and the Redskins made the playoffs. He caught 75 passes for 1,112 yards and eight touchdowns. The Redskins went on to beat the Philadelphia Eagles, 20-6, in an NFC Wild Card game. Clark caught four passes for 63 yards and a touchdown. The Redskins lost the next week to the San Francisco 49ers, 28-10. In 1991, Clark and the Redskins tore through the NFL. He caught 70 passes for 1,340 yards and ten touchdowns. His 19.1 yards per catch was second in the NFL. Clark caught four passes for 203 yards and three touchdowns in Washington's 56-17 rout of the Atlanta Falcons in week 11. The Redskins finished 14-2, won the NFC East, and claimed home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Washington beat Atlanta, 24-7, and crushed Detroit, 41-10, to earn a berth in Super Bowl XXVI against the Buffalo Bills. Clark had a big day with seven catches for 114 yards and a touchdown in Washington's 37-24 defeat of the Bills. The Redskins led 24-0 early in the third quarter, but Buffalo cut the lead to 24-10. His 30-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter was instrumental in thwarting a comeback attempt by the Bills. Clark, Monk, and Sanders gave the Redskins one of the best receiving corps in the NFL during the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were known as The Posse. Clark was long known as the most fiery spirit of the bunch, and he was known to run laps around RFK Stadium after touchdowns and during Redskins comebacks. Clark signed with the Phoenix Cardinals as a free agent prior to the 1993 season, and the Redskins have only made the playoffs five times since as of the end of the 2018 season. Clark retired from the NFL after the 1995 season. In his 11 NFL seasons, he caught 699 passes for 10,856 yards and 65 touchdowns, while rushing for 54 yards and gaining 62 yards on nine punt returns. He also had twenty-seven 100-yard games wearing the Redskins uniform. Clark was a four-time Pro Bowl selection in 1986, 1987, 1990, and 1991. He was also a three-time All-Pro selection. He led his team in receiving seven times (1986, 1987, 1989–1992, 1994), and won two Super Bowls, Super Bowl XXII and Super Bowl XXVI, during his NFL career. Clark was the first wide receiver in NFL history to catch at least 50 passes in his first ten NFL seasons. As of 2009, the only other players to do so have been Marvin Harrison and Torry Holt. Clark was the owner of the now closed South Beach Restaurant and Martini Lounge in Bethesda, Maryland. He was inducted into the Redskins Ring of Honor on October 7, 2007 and concluded his speech with, ""We are going to spank Detroit's butt."" The Redskins won the game, 34-3. In 2007, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.",26188,755,2019-20,12.0,0.0,158.0,3.0,7.7,0.382,2.1,6.6,0.31,0.9,1.1,0.8,0.5,0.5,1.0,3.2,5.0,8.2,0.2,0.5,1.4,0.5,1.6,8.4,22.0,Orlando Magic

In 2011, talks were initiated for Clarkson to play for the Philippines men's national basketball team. However, Clarkson did not meet the FIBA eligibility requirements to be considered a Filipino citizen as he acquired his Philippine passport after the age of 16. He is eligible, though, to play for the team as a naturalized citizen. Clarkson visited the Philippines in August 2015 upon the invitation from Manuel V. Pangilinan to observe the training of Gilas Pilipinas, aside from fulfilling his commitments as endorser of Smart Communications. In an interview, SBP Executive Director Sonny Barrios confirmed that Clarkson has carried a Philippine passport since he was 12 and so he will not need to go through the naturalization process to be able to represent the Philippines in international competitions. Clarkson did not make the final cut due to scheduling conflicts with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers agreed to let Clarkson play, but the NBA collective bargaining agreement requires that national team play should not interfere with the Lakers team requirements, which expected players to report in September 28; however, the tournament ran until October 3. Clarkson expressed his disappointment that he won't be able to represent the Philippines for the 2015 FIBA Asia Championship. Clarkson was initially included to the 17-man pool of the Philippines for its lineup for the final Olympic Qualifying Tournament for the 2016 Rio Olympics. However, due to time constraints and a complicated eligibility process, the team instead opted for the services of Andray Blatche as its naturalized player due to the team's lack in size. In August 2018, the NBA cleared Clarkson to play for the Philippine team in the 2018 Asian Games that was held from August 18 to September 2, 2018 with a one-time exception. Clarkson was able to play for the Philippines for the first time. His first game with the national team was against China in which Clarkson led all scorers with 28 points but fell short of the match 82–80. In his second game with the national team, Clarkson once again led his team with a 25-point performance but could not overcome Korea. The team bowed out of a podium finish. Clarkson managed to get his first win with the national team, defeating Japan 113–80, in which he recorded 22 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Clarkson ended the tournament with a win, beating Syria 109–55 with a 29-point performance earning the Philippines a fifth-place finish, its best in 16 years. Clarkson has dual citizenship with the Philippines and the United States. His Filipino citizenship is by virtue of ancestral descent.His father Mike Clarkson is African-American, while his mother Annette Davis is of half Filipino descent.",26192,761,2019-20,24.0,0.0,611.0,8.8,18.1,0.487,3.3,8.5,0.386,5.5,9.6,0.577,1.9,2.6,0.75,0.9,3.0,3.9,2.4,0.9,0.4,1.5,2.4,22.9,29.0,Utah Jazz

Connaughton previously played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball and men's basketball teams. He was selected by the Orioles in the fourth round of the 2014 MLB Draft. The Brooklyn Nets selected him in the second round of the 2015 NBA Draft and traded him to the Portland Trail Blazers. Connaughton attended St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts, where he starred in three sports, playing quarterback in football and multiple positions in both baseball and basketball.He received major interest in baseball from schools in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, with Boston College (BC), the University of Virginia, and his original first choice, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who all made him scholarship offers.Connaughton's sporting trajectory changed during the summer between his junior and senior years. At that time, he had only received a basketball offer from home-state Bentley University, in NCAA's Division II. He suddenly emerged as a major basketball prospect after what ESPN.com writer Jeff Goodman called ""one spectacular week"" at the Amateur Athletic Union national tournament in Orlando, Florida, including a game where he had 33 points and 20 rebounds. Connaughton himself would later say, ""That week completely changed my entire life."" He then began receiving multiple offers in basketball as well as baseball, with many schools willing to let him play both sports. He eventually chose the University of Notre Dame over BC, the University of Miami, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Vanderbilt University.In 2011, Connaughton's senior year, he was named the Gatorade Massachusetts Boys Basketball Player of the Year.As a pitcher for the baseball team, he had an 11–2 win–loss record with a 1.75 earned run average (ERA) and 160 strikeouts in 90 innings pitched as a senior.According to the baseball scouting site Perfect Game, Connaughton was rated as the 33rd-best player in that year's Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, but he fell to the 38th round, where he was selected by the San Diego Padres, when he made it clear he planned to attend college.He followed through on his commitment to Notre Dame, choosing not to sign with the Padres.At Notre Dame, Connaughton played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish as a member of their college baseball and college basketball teams. In his freshman year for the basketball team, Connaughton was one of three players to appear in all of Notre Dame's 34 games. He averaged 7.0 points per game, 4.4 rebounds per game, and 0.9 assists per game while playing 24.1 minutes per game. The Fighting Irish appeared in the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, but lost to Xavier University in the second round. Connaughton scored 10 points with two assists and two rebounds in 34 minutes of play during the loss. He then joined the baseball team as a relief pitcher.As a sophomore, in 2013, Connaughton averaged 8.9 points per game for the basketball team, and had a 1.71 ERA for the baseball team.In the summer of 2013, he pitched in collegiate summer baseball for the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League.In his junior year, he averaged 13.8 PPG for the basketball team and had a 3.92 ERA in ten games started, which included two complete games, for the baseball team. After his junior year, he was forthright about his intent to return to Notre Dame for his senior basketball season, despite warnings that it would impact his prospects for the upcoming baseball draft. He was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the fourth round, with the 121st overall selection, of the 2014 MLB Draft. One high-ranking MLB executive believed that Connaughton would have been drafted in the first two rounds had he not been committed to returning to Notre Dame for his senior basketball season, telling Goodman, ""He definitely cost himself some money,"" as he expected Connaughton could have earned $1 million if he was willing to quit basketball.He agreed to terms with the Orioles, receiving a signing bonus of over $400,000,with the Orioles permitting Connaughton to play basketball for the Irish in his senior year. As a senior, Notre Dame's basketball team won its first Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship. He took part in a 2015 tournament game against Kentucky for a Final Four berth, narrowly lost by his team after having sustained a lead until the six-second mark. Connaughton was determined to finish his degree at Notre Dame, and had a 3.0 grade point average with the university's Mendoza College of Business.He ultimately graduated from Notre Dame in spring 2015. Connaughton made his professional baseball debut with the Aberdeen IronBirds of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League, in which he registered a 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) fastball. At the end of July 2014, he left the IronBirds to return to the Fighting Irish basketball team. Even though the Orioles allowed him to pursue an NBA career, they never made any attempts to recoup the $428,000 signing bonus. As a result, the ballclub will continue to control his contractual baseball rights through 2020, which can be extended for six additional years if Baltimore places him on its major league roster. Connaughton was drafted with the 41st pick by the Brooklyn Nets in the 2015 NBA draft. His draft rights, along with Mason Plumlee, were then traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Steve Blake and the draft rights to the 23rd pick in the draft, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. He signed a three-year deal with the Trail Blazers on July 9. The first two years of the contract are guaranteed, with the stipulation that Connaughton not play professional baseball during that timespan. He made his debut for the Trail Blazers on October 30, 2015, scoring five points in a loss to the Phoenix Suns. He appeared in 34 games for the Trail Blazers as a rookie. On April 13, 2017, in the Blazers' 2016–17 season finale, Connaughton scored a career-high 19 points in a 103–100 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. In the Trail Blazers' 2017–18 season opener on October 18, 2017, Connaughton scored a career-high 24 points while making 4 of 6 3-pointers in a 124–76 win over the Phoenix Suns. On August 1, 2018, Connaughton signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. He competed in the Slam Dunk Contest at the 2020 NBA All-Star Game. In Goodman's 2015 story on Connaughton and his decision between two sports, many key individuals in his life testified to his character. His father Len noted, ""Patrick is of high moral character and wasn't going to lie to people. That eliminated a bunch of  teams from taking him at all.""Notre Dame head basketball coach Mike Brey added, ""In my 15 years here, no one has been more responsible than Pat Connaughton. He's an unbelievable ambassador for us and has shown tremendous loyalty.""Family adviser Sam Samardzija, brother of current San Francisco Giants pitcher and former Notre Dame baseball and football star Jeff Samardzija, said about Connaughton, ""He's not common—kind of like Jeff and [NFL quarterback] Russell Wilson. Not a lot of guys like him come around. He's just wired differently.""Connaughton only allowed himself one luxury with his signing bonus, buying a new Jeep Wrangler. He told Goodman, ""The signing bonus is a ton of money, especially for a 21-year-old. But I'm not going to live off that money. At some point, I'm going to live off a college degree.""",26200,820,2019-20,51.0,0.0,928.0,3.8,8.4,0.447,1.4,4.3,0.315,2.4,4.1,0.585,0.7,1.0,0.72,1.7,6.9,8.6,3.1,0.6,1.0,1.6,1.9,9.6,17.0,Milwaukee Bucks

He is the son of former NBA player Corey Crowder. Not being heavily recruited out of high school, Crowder committed to South Georgia Technical College and later Howard College, where he led the team to an NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship in his sophomore season. While at Howard College, Crowder was also named State Farm Junior College Player of the Year. Later, he transferred to Marquette, where he was named Big East Player of the Year in his senior season. After his senior year ended, he became eligible for the 2012 NBA draft, where he was drafted 34th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers and traded to the Dallas Mavericks on draft night. In 2014, Crowder was traded to the Boston Celtics. He spent three years in Boston before being traded back to his draft team, the Cavaliers, in August 2017. In 2018, he was traded to the Utah Jazz and he has also played for the Memphis Grizzlies. Jae Crowder was born on July 6, 1990, in Villa Rica, Georgia, to Helen Thompson and basketball player Corey Crowder. Crowder attended Villa Rica High School, where he played as starting quarterback for the football team and as starting point guard for the basketball team. Crowder spent the summer holidays in Florida, working out and training with his father, then a professional basketball player, with 2 years experience in the NBA playing in Europe. Growing up, he was undersized and overweight, weighing nearly 200 pounds in his junior year. Eventually, he called his father, to help him lose weight. By the end of his junior year, he had grown to 6'4"" and had significantly improved his physical conditioning.Crowder was not heavily recruited out of high school, although he had some offers in football. He committed to South Georgia Technical College, a college in Americus, Georgia. He later transferred to Howard College for his sophomore season. After his junior college eligibility ended, he transferred to Marquette.In his only season with South Georgia Tech, he led the Jets to their first-ever NJCAA national tournament appearance in his freshman season, under head coach Steven Wright, with the team finishing with a 21–7 record.He was named Georgia Junior College Athletic Association Player of the Year that season.In his sophomore season with the Howard Hawks in 2010, Crowder was not only named Junior College Player of the Year but also helped the team win its first-ever NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. In the final game he registered 27 points and 12 rebounds in an 85–80 overtime victory against Three Rivers Community College. He averaged 18.9 points, 9.0 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 2.4 steals per game as a sophomore while shooting 46.0 percent from the field and 76.0 percent from the free throw line.After his season with the Howard Hawks, Crowder transferred to Marquette University, selecting the Golden Eagles over UNLV, Georgia Tech, Texas Tech and Illinois State, among others.He averaged 11.8 points and 6.8 rebounds in his first season with Marquette.Some basketball statisticians believe Crowder was statistically the best all-around player during the 2010–11 season.On January 1, 2011, Crowder recorded a career-high 29 points and 8 rebounds in a game against the West Virginia Mountaineers.On March 30, 2012, Crowder was named East Perfect Player of the Game in the Reese's College All-Star Game.For the 2011–2012 season, Crowder averaged 17.5 points and 8.4 rebounds per game.Crowder led Marquette to a second-place finish in the Big East, as well as their second consecutive Sweet 16. During the same season, he was named Big East Player of the Year, as well as an AP Second-Team All American.After finishing his college career, Jae Crowder decided to enter the 2012 NBA draft, where he was projected to be a second round draft pick.Crowder was taken 34th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers; however, a draft night-trade with the Mavericks sent him to Dallas, along with 24th overall pick Jared Cunningham and 33rd overall pick Bernard James, in exchange for 17th overall pick Tyler Zeller and Kelenna Azubuike. He was officially signed on July 20, 2012 on a non-guaranteed two-year contract, like all second round draft picks. His Marquette teammate Darius Johnson-Odom was also drafted with the 55th overall pick. Due to his strong showing in NBA Summer League and preseason games, he was described as ""the steal of the NBA draft"", averaging 11.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.9 steals, 1.6 assists and 0.8 blocks in 22 minutes per game in the preseason and 16.6 points, 1.6 assists, 5.4 rebounds, 0.8 blocks, 2.0 steals and 41.7 percent shooting in Summer League, where he was also voted into the All-Summer League team. This strong showing raised expectations in the young player, as he was viewed as possibly the Mavericks' new franchise player and possibly a future All-Star. His stellar play earned him a spot in coach Rick Carlisle's rotation. He debuted in the season-opening win against the Los Angeles Lakers. After Dirk Nowitzki missed most of the early season with an arthroscopic knee surgery and starting small forward Shawn Marion was also injured, Crowder became the team's starting small forward. With Marion and Nowitzki's returns, Crowder's minutes decreased. His contribution started to dwindle a bit starting around the all-star break, when he admitted that he hit the ""rookie wall"". The Mavericks were never able to recover from Nowitzki's injury and missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years, with Crowder averaging 5 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in 17.3 minutes. On November 5, 2013, Crowder scored a then career-high 18 points in a 123–104 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.

On June 10, 2014, the Mavericks exercised their team option on Crowder's contract. With the offseason additions of forwards Al-Farouq Aminu and Richard Jefferson, Crowder's minutes subsequently dropped to start the 2014–15 season, falling out of coach Rick Carlisle's frontcourt rotation. On November 9, 2014, he scored a season-high 15 points on 5-of-6 shooting in a 105–96 loss to the Miami Heat. On December 18, 2014, Crowder was traded, along with Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick, a 2016 second-round pick and a $12.9 million trade exception, to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Rajon Rondo and Dwight Powell. On January 12, 2015, he scored a then career-high 22 points in a 108–100 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. On April 14, 2015, he hit an off-balance fall-away two-point shot from deep on the right wing with 0.8 seconds left, lifting Boston to a 95–93 win over the Toronto Raptors. After averaging just 3.6 points in 10.6 minutes per game with Dallas to start the 2014–15 season, Crowder became an important role player for the Celtics in Brad Stevens' rotation, and subsequently lifted his averages to 9.5 points in 24.2 minutes per game. On July 27, 2015, Crowder re-signed with the Celtics to a reported five-year, $35 million contract. On December 18, 2015, he scored a career-high 24 points in a loss to the Atlanta Hawks. He topped that mark on January 4, 2016, scoring 25 points in a 103–94 win over the Brooklyn Nets. On January 13, he tied his career high of 25 points in a 103–94 win over the Indiana Pacers. On March 14, he was ruled out for two weeks with a right ankle sprain. He returned to action on March 31 against the Portland Trail Blazers after missing eight games. In the Celtics' season opener on October 26, 2016, Crowder scored 21 points in a 122–117 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He appeared in the team's first four games of the season, but then missed eight straight games with a sprained left ankle. He returned to action on November 19, scoring nine points in a 94–92 win over the Detroit Pistons. On March 17, 2017, he recorded season highs with 24 points and 12 rebounds in a 98–95 win over Brooklyn. On March 26, 2017, he set a new season high with 25 points in a 112–108 win over the Miami Heat. In Game 1 of the Celtics' Eastern Conference semifinal match-up with the Washington Wizards, Crowder scored a playoff career-high 24 points, helping the Celtics win 123–111. On August 22, 2017, Crowder was traded, along with Isaiah Thomas, Ante Žižić and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 unprotected first round pick, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Eight days later, the Celtics agreed to send the Cavaliers a 2020 second-round draft pick via the Miami Heat to complete the trade. On November 20, 2017, Crowder scored a season-high 18 points against the Detroit Pistons.

On July 6, 2019, the Memphis Grizzlies acquired Crowder from the Jazz as part of a package for Mike Conley Jr. On October 27, Crowder hit the game-winning buzzer beating 3-pointer to defeat the Brooklyn Nets.  On February 6, 2020, Crowder was traded to the Miami Heat in a 3-team trade. Crowder is known for his good all around-play and his positional flexibility. He is a rugged defender with a strong, muscular stature and a good rebounder. He has a good three point shot and postplay, as well as being solid from long range, averaging .498 from the field and .345 from the three-point line in his senior season at Marquette.Crowder has a tremendous work ethic, growing from a chubby kid into a muscular player, training with intense will and commitment to improve his skills.Rick Carlisle compared him to Tayshaun Prince, whom he coached while with the Detroit Pistons, stating: ""Jae just has a maturity beyond his years. He’s got a natural motor and a natural, real, pure basketball energy. He’s the kind of guy who would fit in on any team."" Crowder's father, Corey, played in the NBA for the Utah Jazz and the San Antonio Spurs and had a 14 year-spanning career as a professional, mostly playing in Europe. Crowder has seven siblings.He majored in communication studies at Marquette's Diederich College of Communication.",26212,900,2019-20,4.0,1.0,114.0,6.3,11.7,0.541,4.4,7.9,0.56,1.9,3.8,0.5,4.4,4.7,0.933,1.3,6.9,8.2,1.6,1.9,0.9,0.6,4.1,21.5,16.0,Miami Heat

On June 27, 2016, the Kings tendered a qualifying offer to Curry, but on July 3, the team rescinded their qualifying offer, making Curry an unrestricted free agent. On July 15, 2016, Curry signed with the Dallas Mavericks. He made his debut for the Mavericks in their season opener on October 26 against the Indiana Pacers. In 16 minutes off the bench, he recorded seven points, three rebounds, one assist and three steals in a 130–121 overtime loss. On November 8, he scored a then career-high 23 points in a 109–97 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. He tied that mark on November 21, scoring 23 points with five three-pointers as a starter in a 96–91 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Curry missed four games in early December with a right knee sprain. On January 29, 2017, he had career highs of 24 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Mavericks to a 105–101 win over San Antonio. On February 24, 2017, he set a new career high with 31 points in a 97–84 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Three days later, he had a 29-point effort to go with five three-pointers in a 96–89 win over the Miami Heat. On October 7, 2017, Curry was ruled out indefinitely after being diagnosed with a stress reaction of his left tibia. On February 6, 2018, he was ruled out for the entire season after it was determined he required surgery on his left tibia. On July 6, 2018, Curry signed a two-year contract with the Portland Trail Blazers, which included a player option for the second year. On January 26, 2019, he scored 22 points in a 120–111 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On February 5, he was selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest during All-Star Weekend.

5411,921,Stephen Curry,Wardell Stephen Curry II,G,6-3,190.0,March 14 1988,"Akron, Ohio",False,/players/c/curryst01.html,10.0,[10],"Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II (/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən; born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A six-time NBA All-Star, Curry has been named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice and won three NBA championships with the Warriors. Many players and analysts have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history.He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams to regularly utilize the three-point shot.The son of former NBA player Dell Curry and older brother of current NBA player Seth, Curry played college basketball for the Davidson Wildcats. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, Curry also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made, and was then selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. In 2014–15, Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he became the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and to lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals in 2017, 2018 and 2019, winning back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018. During the 2012–13 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season, with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. Curry is currently third in all-time made three-pointers in NBA history, and alongside teammate Klay Thompson, the pair have earned the nickname of the Splash Brothers; in 2013–14, they set the record for combined three-pointers in an NBA season with 484, a record they broke the following season (525), and again in the 2015–16 season (678). Wardell Stephen Curry II is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron, Ohio while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.The family briefly relocated to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season. He was also a member of Toronto 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario, pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk. Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship. Following Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference, all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame. He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade. Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, ""Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special."" In his first collegiate game, against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game, against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out 4 assists, and grabbed 9 rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring ability helped the Wildcats to a 29–5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-pointer of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for 3-point field goals. Curry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6, 2007. On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13 seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82–70. At the end of his freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, All-freshman team, and first team All-SoCon. He was also honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, he was selected for the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping Team USA to a silver medal finish. In his sophomore season in 2007–08, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) and again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular season record, and a 20–0 conference record. As a result of Curry's exceptional play, Davidson earned its third straight NCAA Tournament bid. On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969, 82–76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from 3-point range. On March 23, Davidson played second seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown, ranked eighth nationally, entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74–70 comeback victory. On March 28, 2008, Curry led Davidson to another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. Curry scored 33 points as Davidson won 73–56 to advance to the Elite 8. Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games. Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers with 158. On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but Davidson lost 57–59, and the Jayhawks went on to win the championship. Curry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008. He also was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA Tournament, becoming the first player from a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994. Curry was nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category. After Davidson's loss against Kansas in the NCAA Regional Finals, Curry announced that he would return for his junior year. He stated that he wanted to develop as a point guard, his likely position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, Curry scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82–78 loss to Oklahoma. He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh straight game. On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points, in Davidson's 97–70 win over Winthrop. On November 25, against Loyola, Curry was held scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed him. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78–48. In Davidson's next game (11 days later), Curry matched his career high of 44 in a 72–67 win over North Carolina State. Curry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford. On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career. On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99–56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy. Davidson won the 2008–09 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18–2 in the conference. In the 2009 Southern Conference Tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals and won 84–68. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference tournament history. In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points but Davidson lost 52–59. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach Bobby Cremins, the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70–63. Davidson then fell 68–80 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats. In his final season at Davidson, Curry averaged 28.6 points, 5.6 assists, and 2.5 steals. He was the NCAA scoring leader and was named a consensus first team All-American. Curry opted out of his senior year at Davidson, but he stated that he still planned to earn his degree. On June 25, 2009, Curry was selected with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. He appeared in 80 games (77 starts) during the 2009–10 season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes. His second half of the season vaulted him into the rookie of the year race. He was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January, March and April, finishing as the only Western Conference rookie to win the award three times. He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award behind Tyreke Evans and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection, becoming the first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001–02 to earn All-Rookie First Team honors. He scored 30-plus points eight times, setting the most 30-point games by any rookie in 2009–10 and the most since LeBron James had 13 and Carmelo Anthony had 10 in 2003–04. Curry had five 30-point/10-assist games, which tied Michael Jordan for the second-most 30-point/10-assist games by a rookie (Oscar Robertson is first with 25). He became just the sixth rookie in NBA history to post a 35-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound game when he registered his first career triple-double with 36 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers on February 10. In the Warriors' season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 14, Curry recorded a then career-high 42 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, becoming the first rookie since Robertson in February 1961 to register at least those numbers in each category in the same game. Curry finished his rookie season with 166 three-pointers, which were the most ever by a rookie in NBA history. In 2010–11, Curry appeared in 74 games (all starts), averaging 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.47 steals in 33.6 minutes per contest. His free throw percentage of .934 (212–227 FT) established a new Warriors single-season record, surpassing the previous mark of .924 set by Rick Barry in 1977–78. He also became the first Warriors player to lead the NBA in free throw percentage since Mark Price in 1996–97. Curry registered 20-or-more points 35 times, including seven 30-plus performances. He posted a season-high 39 points and a then career-high 14 field goals (on 20 FGA) against the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 5. In February 2011, during All-Star Weekend, Curry won the Skills Challenge and registered 13 points, eight assists and six rebounds in 28 minutes as a member of the Sophomore squad in the Rookie Challenge. In May 2011, he was named the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award, and underwent surgery on his right ankle. In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Curry appeared in 26 games (23 starts), averaging 14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.50 steals in 28.2 minutes per contest. He missed 40 games due to right ankle and foot injuries, including the last 28 games with a sprained right ankle and subsequent surgery on the ankle, which was performed on April 25. Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season, Curry signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Warriors. At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history. Over the course of the year, Curry and backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them the nickname the ""Splash Brothers"". In 2012–13, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs of 22.9 points (seventh in NBA) and 6.9 assists to go with 4.0 rebounds and 1.62 steals in 38.2 minutes. He established a new NBA single-season three-point record with 272 three-pointers, eclipsing the previous mark set by Ray Allen (269 in 2005–06), doing so on 53 less attempts than Allen did with Seattle. Curry earned Western Conference Player of the Month honors for the month of April, averaging 25.4 points, 8.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 2.13 steals in eight games in the final month of the season to become the third Warrior to ever win the award, joining Chris Mullin (November 1990 and January 1989) and Bernard King (January 1981). He tallied two of the NBA's top six scoring games with 54 points on February 27 at New York and 47 on April 12 at Los Angeles, becoming the first Warrior to score 45-plus at New York and L.A. in the same season since Rick Barry in 1966 (joining Barry, Guy Rodgers and Wilt Chamberlain as the only four Warriors to do so). Curry's 54 points against the Knicks included a career-best and franchise-record 11 three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50-plus points while hitting 10-plus three-pointers in a game. It was the most scored by a Warrior since Purvis Short tallied 59 points in 1984. He appeared in the playoffs for the first time in 2013, with the Warriors earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference. In 12 playoff games (all starts), he averaged 23.4 points, 8.1 assists and 3.8 rebounds. He set a new franchise record with 42 playoff three-pointers, eclipsing the Warriors' career playoff mark of 29 previously held by Jason Richardson, giving him a total of 314 three-pointers for the season to become the first player in NBA history to hit at least 300 threes in a single season. In 2013–14, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs of 24.0 points (seventh in the NBA) and 8.5 assists (fifth) to go with 4.3 rebounds and 1.63 steals, becoming the first player in Warriors history to average 24 points and eight assists in a single season (ninth player in NBA history). He led the league in three-pointers made for a second consecutive season with 261 (fourth-most ever in a single season), the first player since Ray Allen in 2001–02 and 2002–03 to lead the league in threes in back-to-back seasons. He was named Western Conference Player of the Month for April and earned All-NBA Second Team honors, becoming first Warriors player named to the First or Second Team since 1993–94. On December 7 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry eclipsed Jason Richardson (700) as the franchise's leader in career three-pointers. In February, he made his first All-Star appearance, becoming the Warriors' first All-Star starter since Latrell Sprewell in 1995. He scored a season-high 47 points on April 13 against the Portland Trail Blazers for his third 40-point game of the year. He finished the regular season tied for second in the NBA in triple-doubles with four, the most by a Warrior in a single season since Wilt Chamberlain had five in 1963–64. Seeded sixth for the second consecutive postseason, the Warriors were defeated in seven games by the Los Angeles Clippers. Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, the Warriors hired former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr as their new head coach. Kerr implemented significant changes to Golden State's schemes, including playing at a faster pace and giving Curry more freedom to shoot, helping the team evolve into a title contender. On February 4, Curry scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Dallas Mavericks. He was the leading vote-getter for the All-Star Game and won the Three-Point Contest on All-Star Saturday night. On April 9, he broke his own league record for three-pointers made in a season during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers. The Warriors finished the year with 67 wins and Curry was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player after posting averages of 23.8 points, 7.7 assists and 2 steals per game. Over the course of the season, he sat out 17 fourth quarters due to Golden State's wide margins of victory. In Game 5 of the Conference Semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry became the first player in league history to register six three-pointers and six steals in a game. In Game 6, he made a playoff career-high eight three-pointers en route to a series-clinching victory. In Game 3 of the Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets, he broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single postseason. The Warriors went on to defeat the Rockets to earn a Finals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where Curry struggled to start the series, converting on only 22 percent of his field goals in Game 2. In Game 5, he scored 37 points, and in Game 6, Golden State closed out the series to win their first championship in 40 years. For the Finals, Curry averaged 26 points and 6.3 assists per game. To start the 2015–16 season, Curry became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989–90 to score 118 points in his team's first three games, including a season-high 53 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in the third game. The Warriors made NBA history on November 24 when they became the first team ever to start 16–0 with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, before improving to 24–0 on December 11 with a double-overtime win over the Boston Celtics. Their streak was broken the following day against the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 28, Curry recorded his sixth career triple-double with 23 points, a career-high 14 rebounds and 10 assists in a 122–103 win over the Sacramento Kings. During the game against the Kings, Curry was guarded by his brother Seth for the first time in their NBA careers. On January 22, he recorded his second triple-double of the season with 39 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 122–110 win over the Indiana Pacers. He made eight three-pointers in the game to reach 200 for the season, becoming the first player in NBA history to make 200 three-pointers in four straight seasons. On February 3, he made 11 three-pointers (including seven in the first quarter) and scored 51 points (including a career-high 36 points in the first half) to lead the Warriors past the Washington Wizards 134–121. His 51 points tied Gilbert Arenas and Michael Jordan for the Verizon Center record. During the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend, Curry competed in his third straight All-Star game for the West, and competed in the Three-Point Shootout, where he lost in the final round to teammate Klay Thompson. At 48–4, the Warriors entered the All-Star break with the best record through 52 games in NBA history, one win better than the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls and 1966–67 Philadelphia 76ers. On February 25, Curry made 10 three-pointers and scored 51 points to lead the Warriors past the Orlando Magic 130–114. Curry topped 50 points for the third time in 2015–16, the first player to do it that many times since LeBron James and Dwyane Wade did so in 2008–09. Curry also surpassed Kyle Korver's mark of 127 straight games with a three-pointer. In the following game two days later, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in overtime thanks to a Curry three-pointer with 0.6 seconds remaining. Curry finished with 46 points as his winning shot was his 12th three-pointer, tying the NBA single-game record (with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall). He also broke his own NBA record for threes in a season, leaving the new mark at 288. On March 7, in a win over the Magic, Curry scored 41 points and became the first player in NBA history to make 300 regular-season three-pointers. On April 1, Curry missed a three-pointer to tie the game against the Celtics with 5.3 seconds left, as the Warriors suffered their first home defeat since January 27, 2015, snapping an NBA-record 54-game winning streak in the regular season at Oracle Arena. On April 7, Curry scored 27 points to help the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season with a 112–101 win over the San Antonio Spurs. In the Warriors' regular-season finale on April 13 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry achieved another shooting milestone, becoming the first player to make 400 three-pointers in a season by knocking down 10 from long range on his way to 46 points and 402 total three-pointers. With a 125–104 win over the Grizzlies, the Warriors became the first 73-win team in NBA history, surpassing the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls' 72–10 record to finish the 2015–16 season with just nine losses. With the conclusion of the regular season, Curry became the seventh player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club, representing the shooting percentages from the field (.504), beyond the arc (.454), and the free-throw line (.908). The league's leading scorer at 30.1 points per game, Curry was named the league's first ever unanimous MVP, becoming the 11th player in NBA history to win the award in consecutive seasons and the first guard to do so since Steve Nash in 2004–05 and 2005–06. In the 2016 playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets in the first round despite Curry only playing in the first half of games one and four due to injury. A right MCL injury kept him out of the first three games of the second round. In game four of the second-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers, Curry came off the bench to score 40 points in a 132–125 overtime win. Seventeen of those points came in the extra period, an NBA record for points scored by an individual in overtime. Curry led the Warriors to a 4–1 victory over the Trail Blazers, as they moved on to the Western Conference Finals to face the Oklahoma City Thunder. After going down 3–1, he helped the Warriors rally to win the series 4–3 and advance to their second straight NBA Finals. In the Finals, Curry's play relative to his regular season performance remained inconsistent, as it had been since he returned from injury against Portland. Still, he broke Danny Green's record of 27 three-pointers made in a Finals. However, the Warriors, despite being up 3–1 in the series, were defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games and became the first team in NBA Finals history to lose a series after leading 3–1. In the game seven loss, Curry scored 17 points on 6-of-19 shooting. On October 28, 2016, Curry hit four three-pointers against the New Orleans Pelicans to reach 1,600 for his career, becoming the 19th player to do so, as well as the fastest to reach the mark. On November 4, Curry's NBA-record streak of 157 straight games with at least one made three-pointer was snapped during the Warriors' 117–97 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers after he went 0-of-10 from three-point range. He had hit a three-pointer in every regular-season game since November 11, 2014. Three days later, he hit 13 three-pointers against New Orleans, setting an NBA record for most three-pointers made in a regular-season game. Curry shot 16-of-26 overall against the Pelicans for his first 40-point game of the season, finishing with 46 in a 116–106 win. On December 11, Curry hit two three-pointers against the Minnesota Timberwolves to pass Steve Nash for 17th on the NBA's career three-pointers list. With 14 points against the Dallas Mavericks on December 30, Curry (11,903) passed Purvis Short (11,894) for seventh place on the Warriors' all-time scoring list. In a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on January 6, 2017, Curry had his second 40-point game of the season and reached the 12,000-point threshold, becoming the seventh player in Warriors history to score 12,000 career points. On January 19, Curry was named a starter on the Western Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. On February 2, he hit his 200th three-pointer of the season in the Warriors' 133–120 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, making him the first player in NBA history to have 200 or more three-pointers in five consecutive seasons. On March 5, he scored 31 points and moved into the top 10 on the NBA's career three-point list in a 112–105 win over the New York Knicks. Curry hit five three-pointers, passing Chauncey Billups for 10th place. Curry helped the Warriors sweep through the first two rounds of the playoffs. In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, Curry scored 40 points and hit a tying 3-pointer with 1:48 remaining to help the Warriors rally from a 25-point deficit to win 113–111; the Warriors overcame their largest halftime deficit ever in the postseason at 20 points. In a 120–108 Game 3 win, Curry scored 21 points and became the franchise leader in postseason points, passing Rick Barry. They went up 3–0 in the series, becoming the third team in NBA history to win their first 11 playoff games. His 36 points in Game 4 led to a 129–115 victory that saw the Warriors advance to the NBA Finals for a third straight year while becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12–0. In Game 2 of the 2017 NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Curry recorded his first career postseason triple-double with 32 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to help the Warriors go up 2–0 in the series with a 132–113 win. Curry helped the Warriors clinch the series and the championship in Game 5 with 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds, as Golden State claimed its second title in three years. On July 1, 2017, Curry agreed to a five-year, $201 million extension with the Warriors, becoming the first NBA player to sign a supermax contract worth over $200 million. He officially signed the contract on July 25. On December 1, he scored 23 points and passed Jason Kidd for eighth place on the career three-pointers made list in a 133–112 win over the Orlando Magic. On December 4, in a 125–115 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, Curry hit five three-pointers to become the fastest NBA player to achieve the milestone of 2,000 career three-pointers, achieving that mark in just 597 games, 227 less than the previous fastest player to achieve that mark, Ray Allen. In that same game, Curry injured his right ankle and subsequently missed 11 games, returning to action on December 30 and scoring 38 points with a season-high 10 3-pointers in a 141–128 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. Curry shot 13 for 17 and 10 of 13 from deep in 26 minutes for his ninth 30-point game of the season. It also marked Curry's ninth career game with 10 or more 3s, the most by any player in NBA history. On January 6, in a 121–105 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, Curry scored 45 points in three quarters. On January 25, he scored 25 points in a 126–113 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Curry became the fifth player in Warriors history to score 14,000 points, ending the game with 14,023 and joining Wilt Chamberlain (17,783), Rick Barry (16,447), Paul Arizin (16,266) and Chris Mullin (16,235) on the franchise list. On January 27, he scored 49 points—with 13 of those over the final 1:42—and hit eight 3-pointers, lifting the Warriors past the Boston Celtics 109–105. On February 22, he had a 44-point effort with eight 3-pointers in a 134–127 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. It was his third 40-point game of the season. On March 2, in a 114–109 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Curry made his 200th 3-point field goal of the season, becoming the first player in NBA history with at least 200 3-pointers in six seasons, having reached the mark in every season since 2012–13. Four days later, in a 114–101 win over the Nets, Curry became the seventh player in Warriors history to make 5,000 career field goals, joining Chamberlain, Barry, Mullin, Arizin, Jeff Mullins and Nate Thurmond. On March 23, against the Hawks, Curry suffered a Grade 2 medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain to his left knee. He subsequently missed nearly six weeks, returning to action in Game 2 of the Warriors' second-round playoff series against the Pelicans. He came off the bench to score 28 points in a 121–116 win. In Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, Curry scored 35 points with five 3-pointers in a 126–85 win over the Houston Rockets. The 41-point victory was the largest in franchise history during the postseason. In Game 6, Curry scored 29 points with five 3-pointers, as the Warriors rallied from an early 17-point deficit to stave off elimination with a 115–86 victory over the Rockets. In Game 7, Curry recorded 27 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds, as the Warriors earned a fourth straight trip to the NBA Finals by beating the Rockets 101–92. In Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Curry hit a Finals-record nine 3-pointers and scored 33 points in a 122–103 win over the Cavaliers. In Game 4, Curry led all scorers with 37 points in a 108–85 win that helped the Warriors clinch their second straight championship with a series sweep over the Cavaliers. Many felt that he should have won Finals MVP. In response, Curry stated, ""At the end of the day, I'm not going to let a  MVP trophy define my career. Three titles ... Wherever that puts us in the conversation in the history of the NBA ... I'm a three-time champ."" Rohan Nadkarni of Sports Illustrated argued that ""the Golden State dynasty started with Stephen Curry. He, for numerous reasons stretching from his incredible talent to his previous ankle injuries, put the Warriors in place to win their third championship in four seasons."" On October 21, 2018, Curry had 30 points and six 3-pointers in a 100–98 loss to the Denver Nuggets, thus moving past Paul Pierce for sixth place on the NBA's career three-point list. Three days later, he scored 51 points with 11 3-pointers in only three quarters in a 144–122 win over the Washington Wizards. He scored 31 in the first half and finished with his sixth career 50-point game and made 10 or more 3s for the 10th time. Curry's third 3-pointer of the night moved him past Jamal Crawford (2,153) for fifth place on the NBA's career list. On October 28, he made seven 3-pointers and finished with 35 points in a 120–114 win over the Brooklyn Nets. Over the first seven games of the season, he made at least five 3-pointers in all seven games, breaking George McCloud's record of six games in a row during the 1995–96 season. The Warriors started the season with a 10–1 record. On November 8 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Curry left the game during the third quarter with a groin injury and the Warriors were unable to recover in a 134–111 loss. Without Curry, the Warriors dropped to 12–7 on November 21 after enduring their first four-game losing streak since March 2013. The Warriors ended November with a 15–8 record, with Curry's strained left groin sidelining him for 11 straight games. Despite Curry's 27 points in his return to the line-up on December 1, the Warriors were defeated 111–102 by the Detroit Pistons. On December 17, he scored 20 points in a 110–93 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, becoming just the fifth player in Warriors history to score 15,000 points during the regular season, joining Wilt Chamberlain (17,783), Rick Barry (16,447), Paul Arizin (16,266) and Chris Mullin (16,235). On December 23, he scored 42 points and made a layup with 0.5 seconds left to lift the Warriors to a 129–127 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. On January 5, he had 10 3-pointers and scored 20 of his 42 points in the fourth quarter of the Warriors' 127–123 win over the Sacramento Kings. On January 11, in a 146–109 win over the Chicago Bulls, Curry made five 3-pointers to surpass Jason Terry (2,282) and move into third place all-time in NBA history behind Ray Allen (2,973) and Reggie Miller (2,560). Two days later, he scored 48 points and hit a season high-tying 11 3-pointers in a 119–114 win over the Dallas Mavericks. On January 16, he scored 41 points with nine 3-pointers to become the first player in NBA history to make eight or more 3s in three straight games, as the Warriors defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 147–140. On January 31, he scored 41 points with 10 3-pointers in a 113–104 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. On February 21, he scored 36 points with 10 3-pointers in a 125–123 win over the Kings. On March 16 against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Curry reached 16,000 career points. On March 29, he made 11 3-pointers and scored 37 points in a 131–130 overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. On April 2, in a 116–102 win over the Nuggets, Curry made five or more 3-pointers in a career-best nine straight games and moved past Mullin for fourth place on the Warriors all-time points list. On April 5, he scored 40 points in a 120–114 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, thus moving past Arizin for third place on the Warriors all-time points list. The Warriors entered the playoffs as the first seed in the Western Conference with a 57–25 record. In Game 1 of the Warriors' first-round playoff series against the Clippers, Curry scored 38 points and made eight 3-pointers to give him the most in postseason history, passing Ray Allen (385). He also had a postseason career-high 15 rebounds and seven assists in a 121–104 win. In Game 6 of the second round, Curry bounced back from the first scoreless first half of his playoff career to score 33 points in the last two quarters to help the Warriors eliminate the Houston Rockets with a 118–113 win and advance to the Western Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the Conference Finals, Curry matched his postseason career high with nine 3-pointers to finish with 36 points in a 116–94 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He averaged a series career-high 36.5 points to help the Warriors sweep the Trail Blazers. It was the highest average by a player in a four-game sweep in NBA history. Curry became the sixth player in NBA history to score 35 or more in the first four games of a series. In Game 4, he had 37 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 119–117 overtime win, as he and Draymond Green became the first teammates in league history to have a triple-double in the same playoff game. In Game 3 of the 2019 Finals, Curry scored a playoff career-high 47 points to go with eight rebounds and seven assists in a 123–109 loss to Toronto Raptors. In Game 5, he helped the Warriors stave off elimination with 31 points in a 106–105 win, thus cutting the Raptors' series lead to 3–2. In Game 6, Curry scored 21 points, but shot just 6 for 17 and went 3 of 11 on 3-pointers, including missing a contested 3-pointer in the waning moments, as the Warriors lost the game and the series with a 114–110 defeat. Curry was expected to take on a greater offensive load in 2019–20 with Thompson out injured and Kevin Durant having left the Warriors as a free agent. On October 30, 2019, against the Phoenix Suns in the fourth game of the season, Curry drove to the basket and collided with the Suns' Aron Baynes, who was trying to take a charge. Baynes fell on Curry's left hand, which required surgery to repair his broken second metacarpal. He is expected to be out at least three months. Curry's first experience with the United States national team came at the 2007 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, where he helped Team USA capture the silver medal. In 2010, he was selected to the senior squad, playing limited minutes at the 2010 FIBA World Championship (known later as FIBA Basketball World Cup) as the United States won the gold medal in an undefeated tournament. In 2014, he took on a larger role with the team, helping them to another undefeated tournament at the 2014 World Cup and scoring 10 points in the final game. On June 6, 2016, Curry withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Olympics in Brazil, citing ankle and knee ailments as the major reason behind the decision. Listed at 6 feet 3 inches tall (1.91 m) and weighing 190 pounds (86 kg), Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position and has career averages of 23.5 points, 6.6 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game. He is a high-percentage free throw shooter, with a career free throw percentage of 90.5% through the end of the 2018–19 season, the highest in NBA history. Curry is the Warriors' all-time free-throw leader, and has led the NBA in free throw percentage four times. Although capable of stealing the ball, having led the league in steals for the 2015–16 season, he is not considered to be an elite defender, and his teammates frequently take the more difficult defensive assignments. He has been selected to five All-NBA Teams and voted league MVP twice. As a leader within the Warriors organization, he played a significant role in the recruitment of former MVP Kevin Durant to the Warriors. Curry's shooting ability ranges from scoring in great volume from underneath the rim all the way to near half-court. Using an unorthodox jump shot, he is able to get the ball out of his hands in under half a second by releasing it on the way up, adding extra arc to his shot and making it difficult to block. The shooting proficiency earned him the nickname ""Baby-Faced Assassin"" during his pre-NBA years and ""Chef Curry"" while in the NBA. He is additionally known for his ball handling and playmaking abilities, and for putting extra pressure on defenses with his long range, leading the NBA in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in 2016. As of January 2019, Curry ranks third in NBA history in career three-point field goal percentage and holds four of the top five seasons in terms of total three-pointers made. He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2,000 career three-pointers, doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record-holder, Ray Allen. A clutch scorer, he often shoots at his best in high-pressure moments, and takes game-winning shots. NBA analysts state that Curry's efficient scoring ability creates a ""gravity"" effect, forcing opposing defenders to double-team him even when he does not have the ball, which creates mismatches that his teammates are able to exploit. With Curry, the Warriors average 10.8 isolations per game; without Curry, they average 15.3 isolations per game. His absence slows the Warriors offense down and leads to less passing and ball movement. With Curry, the Warriors average 1.05 points every shot that comes after an off-ball screen; without Curry, it drops to 0.95 points per game. His absence makes it much easier for defenders to switch on screens. Of Curry's success with or without other elite teammates, Tom Haberstroh of NBC Sports stated, ""You can pluck All-Star after All-Star off the court like flower petals, and the Steph-led Warriors will still dominate like a champion. He's that transcendent of a player.  The Warriors go from plus-16.9 to plus-14.8 to plus-13.9 to plus-14.3 as you keep removing an All-Star from Curry. But as these numbers show, Curry is impervious. He's teammate-agnostic. For those that think Curry would struggle in another organization or in another system, it's clear: He is the system."" Curry is considered by many to be the greatest shooter in NBA history. He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring basketball teams, from high school to the NBA, to regularly utilize the three-point shot.Analysts have referred to him as ""the Michael Jordan of the three-point era,"" stating that he did for the three-point shot what Jordan did for the dunk. The Guardian's Robert O'Connell cites Curry's February 27, 2013 game against the New York Knicks, in which he made 11 of 13 shots from behind the arc en route for a 54-point performance, as the start of the three-point era. The era has been referred to as ""The Steph Effect""and ""the NBA's Three-Point Revolution."" Before Curry, shooting behind the three-point line was more of a novelty, an occasional way of scoring. Catch and shoot players existed, but Curry's success inspired the league to abandon physical play around the basket and to embrace a pace and space and three-point shooting style. The increase in three-point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors' style of play, and to young people wanting to imitate Curry's shooting range. Although this has led to players becoming good at or improving their three-point shot, it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry's range is unique.Curry regularly takes shots from between 30 and 35 feet. He shoots 54 percent from this range, while the NBA makes 35 percent of its threes overall and under 22 percent from between 30 and 35 feet. He can make the shots with elite ball handling, off the dribble, and often with an extremely quick release, from anywhere on the court and with one or more defenders on him. Curry said that he is sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way he does takes work and time.Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated that ""coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals"" and that ""while the Warriors have become the NBA's gold standard and make all those social-media-bound plays, the root of their success is ball movement.""Kirk Goldsberry of ESPN opined that ""one of the keys to  greatness is his range"" and that ""Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever."" Sally Jenkins of The Washington Post stated that he ""moves around behind the three-point line in an ever-widening arc, sinking long distance shots so cleanly that the net seems to snap like fresh laundry in a breeze"" and that a highlight is the ""sheer preposterousness of his shots, and the rate at which he is sinking the most far-fetched of them."" She said that ""in one stretch he hit a mind-expanding 67 percent between 28 and 50 feet."" Warriors Coach Steve Kerr stated that Curry's hand-eye coordination ""is as great as anyone I've ever seen."" Jeff Austin of Octagton concluded that Curry ""had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that form from 40 and 50 feet."" Goldsberry stated that ""no player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry"" and that ""Curry's jumper is so lethal that he has become the most efficient volume scorer on the planet."" His range and efficiency drove the developers of the NBA 2K video game series, in which Curry is featured, to worry that his abilities could not be replicated on screen. Although Curry is commonly cited as the NBA's greatest shooter, where he ranks as one of the greatest NBA players has been more subject to debate. Former NBA player Steve Nash, who is also among the NBA's all-time efficient shooters, said Curry is ""already an all-time great"" and that people question his greatness ""because he doesn't dominate the game physically. He dances. He pays a tax for that. He pays a tax for his great teammates."" Scottie Pippen, who won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls, said that Curry's ""willingness to sacrifice for  is one of the great stories in history"" because Curry welcomed Durant, who is also a top player, to the Warriors without ego. ""If you have a mind for the game, you know that it takes sacrifice to be great. All the greats have to sacrifice something. Otherwise you can't win,"" he said, crediting Curry with being ""one of the greatest guards the game has ever seen."" CBS Sports ranked Curry #19 in their list of ""50 greatest NBA players of all time"". Sports Illustrated ranked him #3, behind Durant and LeBron James, on their ""Top 100 NBA Players of 2019"" list. Sports Illustrated stated that ""Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system"" and that ""the entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn't need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation."" On July 30, 2011, Curry married longtime girlfriend and Toronto native Ayesha Alexander in Charlotte. Together, they have three children, daughters Riley (b. 2012) and Ryan (b. 2015) and son Canon (b. 2018). In July 2019, Curry paid $31 million for a home in Atherton, California. Curry's younger brother, Seth, is also a professional basketball player, and his younger sister, Sydel, played volleyball at Elon University. Curry has been outspoken about his Christian faith. He spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying, ""People should know who I represent and why I am who I am, and that's because of my Lord and Savior."" He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a ""heart for God"" and as a reminder that he plays for God. On some of his ""Curry One"" basketball shoes, there is a lace loop scripted ""4:13"". It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13, which reads ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist (""Love never fails...""). Curry is also an investor in Active Faith, a Christian sports apparel brand. Curry suffers from keratoconus and wears contact lenses to correct his vision. During the 1992 All-Star Weekend, Curry's father entrusted him to Biserka Petrović, mother of future Hall of Fame player Dražen Petrović, while Dell competed in the Three-Point Contest. Following the 2015 NBA Finals, Curry gave Biserka one of his Finals-worn jerseys, which will reportedly be added to the collection of the Dražen Petrović Memorial Center, a museum to the late player in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. Curry is an avid golfer; he played golf in high school, and frequently plays golf with teammate Andre Iguodala. A 5-handicap golfer, Curry participates in celebrity golf tournaments and has played golf alongside Barack Obama. In August 2017, Curry competed in the Ellie Mae Classic on an unrestricted sponsor exemption. Although he missed the first cut, he scored 4-over-74 for both days he participated, surpassing most expectations for an amateur competing in the pro event. In August 2019, Curry and Howard University, a historically black institution in Washington, D.C., jointly announced that the school would add NCAA Division I teams in men's and women's golf starting in the 2020–21 school year, with Curry guaranteeing full funding of both teams for six years. Curry is also a fan of British soccer club Chelsea FC. Curry is one of the most successful players in the NBA, and he has also become an international celebrity, on par with four-time MVP LeBron James. Like James, he has been considered the face of the NBA. His flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite, and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans of the NBA. Curry's jersey was the top seller in the NBA for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 NBA seasons. While discussion has concerned his image as representative of the NBA today, Curry has said that he is not playing to be the face of the NBA ""or to take LeBron's throne or whatever. You know, I'm trying to chase rings, and that's all I'm about. So that's where the conversation stops for me."" ESPN has ranked Curry among the most famous international athletes, while Forbes has ranked him among the world's highest-paid celebrities for his endorsements. ESPN's Kirk Goldsberry reasoned that one reason for Curry's popularity is that while most people are not tall enough to dunk, everyone can attempt a shot, which is something Curry inspires. Owen Davis of Sky Sports echoed this sentiment, stating, ""After all, not everyone is blessed with supreme height and athleticism, but everyone can learn to pass, dribble and shoot. Curry is proof that if you work hard enough, you can still find ways to dominate, no matter your size."" Monte Poole of NBC Sports found Curry to be ""the most human of superstars,"" with a childlike aura to him when he plays with success. His fanbase ranges from very young children to the elderly, and casual or committed fans enjoy his style of play. Poole stated that ""the joy factor exponentially increases"" when Curry is on the court and that ""the sight of this relatively ordinary specimen sending much bigger players into silent surrender is an intoxicant for the Warriors and their fans."" Curry is widely known for his partnership with Under Armour, where he is considered to be the ""face of their footwear line."" Originally signed to Nike, Curry joined with Under Armour in the 2013 offseason. As Curry became MVP and one of the most popular athletes in the world, sales of his shoes have become a major factor for the brand, with stock prices rising and falling based on the success of the Curry shoe line. In September 2017, it was announced that Curry had signed an exclusive autograph contract with Steiner Sports Memorabilia. The full product line will include hand-signed official basketballs and jerseys, autographed photographs of epic moments, flashy framed signs and wall-art, game-used memorabilia, and limited-edition pieces. In October 2018, Curry announced his involvement with the relaunch of Palm, a mobile companion device that pairs with a primary smartphone. Curry is an investor and the leading brand ambassador for Palm, which is a small startup based in San Francisco which licenses the Palm name from TCL Corporation. He is also involved with designing and testing accessories and even helped to name the device. In 2012, Curry started donating three insecticide-treated mosquito nets for every three-pointer he made to the United Nations Foundation's Nothing But Nets campaign to combat malaria. He was first introduced to the malaria cause by Davidson teammate Bryant Barr when they were both in school. Curry visited the White House in 2015 and delivered a five-minute speech to dignitaries as part of President Barack Obama's launch of his President's Malaria Initiative strategy for 2015–2020. In 2015, Curry wore sneakers that had Deah Shaddy Barakat's name on them (one of the victims of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting). According to his sister Suzanne, Deah Barakat was known for his ""love for basketball and anything Steph Curry."" Deah's number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University was Curry's No. 30, and he posed for a photo that was similar to one that Curry did for GQ. Curry said that Barakat's family ""did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality  It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family  I'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday. And hopefully, they know that I've been thinking about them."" Also in 2015, after winning the MVP award following his impressive season, Curry donated his prize vehicle—a 2016 Kia Sorento—to the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a local non-profit organization located in the backyard of Oracle Arena. In December 2018, while on a podcast, Curry questioned whether the Apollo Moon landing actually happened, which received substantial media attention and criticism. NASA offered Curry a tour of the Johnson Space Center and to discuss the matter with him. Curry later said that he was joking about the Moon landing not having happened. He had Under Armour create some shoes inspired by the comment and subsequent discussion. After wearing them to a game, he signed and auctioned them off. The shoes sold for $58,100 on eBay after 113 bids, and the money was donated for STEM education initiatives. In April 2018, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced a wide-ranging, multiyear multimedia deal with Curry's newly-formed production company Unanimous Media (named for Curry becoming the first NBA player in history to be elected Most Valuable Player by a unanimous vote), located on the Sony Pictures studio lot in Culver City. The film and TV deal included electronics, gaming and virtual reality and will focus on faith and family-friendly content. In October 2018, Curry signed on as executive producer of the film Breakthrough, scheduled for release in April 2019. Curry was also executive producer of the film Emanuel, scheduled for US theatrical release in select theaters on June 17, 2019. The film focuses on the responses of family members of victims of the 2015 Charleston church shooting - ""In the face of adversity, in the face of tragedy, how can I get through it?"" Curry said. Beginning in 2019, Curry is both an executive producer and resident golf pro on the American sports reality competition television series Holey Moley.",26215,921,2019-20,4.0,4.0,112.0,8.7,21.2,0.409,2.9,11.9,0.243,5.8,9.3,0.621,5.8,5.8,1.0,1.3,5.1,6.4,8.4,1.6,0.6,4.8,3.2,26.0,10.0,Golden State Warriors

He played college basketball for Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), where in 2013, he set the Atlantic 10 Conference record for made three-point field goals in a single game. Daniels attended William Fleming High School in Roanoke, Virginia. As a senior in 2008–09, he was named Northwest Region Player of the Year and the Roanoke Times Player of the Year after averaging 17 points and six rebounds per game. He also earned Virginia High School Coaches' Association AAA First-Team All-State honors. He played in three straight VHSL AAA State Tournaments, including two appearances in the championship game in 2007 and 2009.As a collegiate player, Daniels played for VCU and under coach Shaka Smart. He played sparingly in his first two seasons for the Rams, though he did appear briefly in VCU's 2011 Final Four game against Butler as a sophomore. As a junior in 2011–12, Daniels became a regular in VCU's ""Havoc"" attack, averaging 24.4 minutes and 10 points per game.As a senior in 2012–13, Daniels started every game and raised his scoring average to 12.3 points per game. He put his name in the record books on January 2, 2013 when he shot 11-of-20 from three-point range en route to 33 points and 10 rebounds in a 109–58 win over East Tennessee State. The eleven three-pointers were a VCU and Atlantic 10 record for a single game.He also set VCU's single season record for three-pointers with 124,and finished with 251 three-pointers in his collegiate career, which ranked second most in the program's history.After going undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft, Daniels joined the Charlotte Bobcats for the 2013 NBA Summer League.On September 30, he signed with the Bobcats,but was later waived on October 10.On October 18, he signed with the Houston Rockets,but was waived again on October 26.

In 2017, he was named the recipient of the NBA All-Star Game MVP Award after setting an All-Star Game scoring record of 52 points en route. Davis is from the South Side of Chicago and played high school basketball for Perspectives Charter School,where he had attended school since sixth grade.The team plays in the Blue Division of the Chicago Public High School League, which is ignored by the media because of its lower level of competition.Perspectives is a charter school that operates as a math and science academy; it has a strong academic reputation, but minimal athletic success.The school had no gymnasium and Davis' middle school basketball teams practiced at a nearby church.In junior high school, he was known as ""the little guy who would shoot threes from the corner"".He ended his freshman year at a height of 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m).By the beginning of his sophomore year, he had grown another 1 inch (2.5 cm), and he finished the year at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m).Davis began his junior basketball season at 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m),saying he felt fortunate to have had such a rapid growth spurt without any knee pains.During his junior year, his family considered having him transfer to one of Chicago's basketball powerhouses, but Hyde Park Career Academy head coach Donnie Kirksey advised against it, saying ""If you're good enough, they'll find you wherever you are"".Perspectives finished the season 8–15.Although he remained unnoticed nationally and locally after three seasons of Chicago Public League play, he was soon thereafter rated as the number one player in the class of 2011 by Scout.com and was listed in the ESPNU 100. Attention came when he started playing on Tai Streets' Meanstreets (AAU team) traveling system in the spring of his junior year.In late April, Syracuse University offered him a scholarship.That spring, NBA Top 100 Camp Director Dave Telep invited him to the camp based on his dominant first half performance of the first game of the Fort Wayne, Indiana Spiece Fieldhouse event.

Before Davis committed to Kentucky, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that his father had asked Kentucky for $200,000 in exchange for a commitment from Davis. The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4, 2010 by Sun-Times reporter Michael O'Brien. Citing ""a reliable source"", he posted the following text: ""Rumors/sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $200,000."" The sentence was later edited to say ""rumors that Davis' commitment is for sale have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago."" The sentence was removed later that day from the Sun-Times' high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer. Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation; on July 30, however, he denied the allegations to the Sun-Times, stating, ""We haven't asked anyone for anything, and no one has offered us anything"". The article was reposted on the Sun-Times' website and included in the print edition on Friday August 6. O'Brien wrote ""sources from three separate universities told the Sun-Times that Davis Sr. asked for money in return for his son's commitment, with the amounts ranging from $125,000 to $150,000."" The University of Kentucky and the Davis family both threatened to sue the Sun-Times over the article, however, no lawsuits were filed by Kentucky or the Davis family. The Davises and Kentucky claim the restated publication was false.

Davis entered the December 12, 2014 contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers with a player efficiency rating (PER) of 32.9, which would be the highest in NBA history if maintained for the full season. Davis was injured in the game and left in the first quarter. Davis was sidelined in the subsequent contest. He was a finalist for December Western Conference Player of the Month. On February 6, despite having missed his last 11 three point shots and having a career 2-for-23 three point career record, Davis made a game winning three point buzzer beater against Oklahoma City Thunder as part of a 41-point, 10-rebound double-double. The 41-point performance marked a New Orleans record 13th consecutive 20-point performance, surpassing Pete Maravich of the 1976–77 New Orleans Jazz. On February 7, 2015, Davis injured his shoulder after falling off the rim when he received an alley-oop. As a result of the injury, he withdrew from the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, and was replaced on the roster by Dirk Nowitzki and in the starting lineup by LaMarcus Aldridge. Davis missed five games in late February and early March to the shoulder sprain. He returned against the Detroit Pistons with a very dominant game performance of 39 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 blocks, numbers that only Hakeem Olajuwon and Dwight Howard had achieved in a game in the prior 30 years. Davis also reached 437 career blocks, a franchise record. On March 9, Davis tied his career high with 43 points and added 10 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal in a 114-103 win against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 15 in a double overtime game against the Denver Nuggets, Davis became the first player in NBA history to tally 36 points, 14 rebounds, 9 blocks and 7 assists in a game since blocks became a statistic in 1973. Only David Robinson has had at least 30 points, 11 rebounds, 8 blocks and 7 assists in a game. On March 16, Davis earned Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, March 9, through Sunday, March 15 and was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month of March.

The playoff berth was Davis' first and the franchise's first since 2011. Davis' season was one of the most impressive in NBA history, finishing the season averaging 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and leading the league in player efficiency rating with 30.89.

Although swept by the overall number one seeded Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the NBA championship, Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Karl Malone as the only players in the past 20 seasons to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in the playoffs. Davis also became the first player in 40 years to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in a player's first playoff series, with the only other players to do so being Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Bob McAdoo. At the end of the season, Davis finished 4th in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting, 5th in the NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting, sixth in the NBA Most Improved Player Award voting. He was selected to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career, becoming the first player to make the first team in his first three seasons since Derrick Rose did so in the 2010–11 NBA season. He was also an NBA All-Defensive Team second team selection. On July 9, 2015, Davis signed a five-year, $145 million contract extension with the Pelicans.

The following day, he was named to the NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge lineup. On February 21, in a win over the Detroit Pistons, Davis scored a franchise-record 59 points and pulled down 20 rebounds. The previous franchise record was 50 points by Jamal Mashburn exactly 13 years earlier against the Memphis Grizzlies. Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Webber as the only NBA players with 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game since 1983. Davis also became just the 20th player in NBA history to score at least 59 points in a game, and became the youngest player in NBA history to score 59 points in a game, and the second youngest (behind Bob McAdoo) to record 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game. The 59 points was an NBA-wide season high at the time. The total was not surpassed until the final night of the season when Kobe Bryant posted 60 in his final career game. Davis posted a third 40-point game (40 points and 13 rebounds) on March 9 against the Charlotte Hornets. On March 20, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a left knee injury and a torn labrum in his left shoulder.

It was the first 50-point, 15-rebound, 5-assist, 5-steal performance in NBA history since steals became an officially recorded statistic in the 1973–74 season. His 50-point night was the second highest scoring output of his career and was the most by any NBA player in a season opener since Michael Jordan scored 54 points in 1989.

A day later, the NBA fined him $50,000 for making his request public. Davis recovered from his injury and was available to play, but the Pelicans said they would hold him out until after the league trade deadline on February 7.

In January 2020, Rich Paul, the agent of Anthony Davis, informed that he would decline the Lakers' offer of a four-year and $146 million max extension, opting to enter free agency, where he can earn a five-year, $202 million max contract in the upcoming summer. References: On May 2, 2012, following a rash of injuries to players who had been on the 20-man Team USA basketball roster in January (notably center Dwight Howard), Davis was named as one of the finalists for the 2012 Olympic basketball team. Davis, along with Greg Monroe, was under consideration to fill the vacancy at center resulting from Howard's injury. Davis would be the first American player since Emeka Okafor (2004) to have competed in the Olympics without any prior NBA experience. By the beginning of July, he was one of six players (along with Blake Griffin, James Harden, Rudy Gay, Andre Iguodala and Eric Gordon) competing for the final three roster spots, according to USA Basketball director Jerry Colangelo. Tyson Chandler, Kevin Love, Griffin and Davis were the only true post players among the final 15. It was reported that Davis ""suffered a severely sprained ankle in a workout"" on June 30 and ""almost assuredly  bypass a chance to play for Team USA  summer in the London Olympics."" On July 12, 2012, however, he was selected for the 2012 USA men's basketball roster after Blake Griffin suffered an injury to the same knee he injured in the 2012 NBA Playoffs. That team went undefeated in the 2012 Olympic tournament in London and won the gold medal match over Spain. Davis was also a member of the 2014 national team that won the gold medal in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup over Serbia on September 14.

He played college basketball for Antelope Valley College and USC. Dedmon attended Lancaster High School in Lancaster, California. Although tall and athletic, Dedmon did not play high school basketball until his senior year due to his mother's religious objections. His mother, a devout Jehovah's Witness, refused to allow him to play organized basketball, believing it might affect his religious devotion.After turning 18, Dedmon, who had already grown to 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m), decided to exercise his age of majority rights and begin playing.After graduating from Lancaster in 2008, Dedmon attended Antelope Valley College as a part-time student and did not play basketball during the 2008–09 season.As a freshman at Antelope Valley in 2009–10, Dedmon, who had grown to 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) tall, helped the Marauders to a 17–14 record while averaging 6.6 points and 7.8 rebounds per game.

He played college basketball for Saint Mary's College and has played on the Australian national team. Dellavedova won an NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. Born and raised in Maryborough, Victoria, Dellavedova is the oldest of three children in his family and is a sixth-generation Italian Australian.His father, Mark, grew up playing Australian rules football and his mother, Leanne, played netball.Dellavedova began playing basketball at the age of four. He attended Maryborough Regional College and played junior basketball for the Maryborough Blazers and played in under-12 and under-14 Bendigo Braves squads.Along with basketball, he played tennis, soccer, and Australian rules football at the junior level.In the latter sport, Dellavedova played the position of wing and kicked a total of 32 goals in 26 games between 1999 and 2001,but gave the game away to focus solely on basketball. Despite giving the game away at a young age, he is an avid supporter of the Collingwood Magpies in the Australian Football League. Throughout his teenage years, he was selected for several Victorian state representative basketball sides and played alongside future Collingwood captain, Scott Pendlebury. In 2007, he moved to Canberra to attend the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) where he spent three years playing in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL). Both of Dellavedova's sisters, Yana and Ingrid, play basketball as well, with Yana playing U.S. college basketball for Long Beach State in 2012–13. Dellavedova was recruited by Randy Bennett and the Saint Mary's College of California in 2009 and signed with the Gaels before the 2009–10 season. He was ranked by ESPN as one of the top junior players in Australia. Dellavedova immediately contributed for the Gaels and started all 34 games as a freshman. In 2009–10, he averaged 12.1 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game. That season, the Gaels won 28 games and reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 2010 NCAA men's basketball tournament.

On 16 January 2013, Dellavedova scored 18 points, including a game-winning three-point buzzer-beater, in a 70–69 victory over the BYU Cougars. The forty-foot shot soon became known as the ""Dellavedagger."" In 2012–13, Dellavedova was an Academic All-America selection and a Senior CLASS Award finalist. Dellavedova graduated from Saint Mary's in 2013 with a degree in psychology.

Despite this criticism, teammate LeBron James and NBA great Charles Barkley both defended Dellavedova's style of play. In Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, in the absence of the injured Kyrie Irving, Dellavedova held Stephen Curry to 0-of-8 shooting and four turnovers while guarding him. The Cavaliers won Game 2 in double-overtime, 95–93, for their first victory of an NBA Finals game in franchise history. In Game 3, Dellavedova scored a playoff career-high 20 points as the Cavaliers defeated the Warriors to take a 2–1 series lead. After the game, Dellavedova was so dehydrated that he needed an IV, and he was quickly taken to the Cleveland Clinic for medical attention.

Dellavedova is well known for his high levels of effort while playing. Multiple players, coaches, and commentators have praised his toughness and competitiveness, particularly on defense. On account of his aggressiveness, some have cast Dellavedova as reckless or dirty. However, multiple current and former players have spoken in defense of Dellavedova, including LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Charles Barkley, and Antonio Davis. Dellavedova's offensive strengths includes his three-point shot, his floater, and his passing ability.

He was just one of two players – the other being Askia Booker – to start all 33 games. By the end of the season, Booker and Dinwiddie became the highest sophomore scoring tandem in school history. Dinwiddie led the team in assists 20 times and was the top scorer on 15 different occasions. He recorded 29 points in a home win over Colorado State, which marked his own career-high scoring record. On February 10, 2012, Dinwiddie recorded a perfect game against Oregon State. He shot 6-for-6 from the field, 4-for-4 from beyond the arc, and 8-for-8 on free throws. This set the school record for most points scored without missing a single shot.He made the remark, ""I see over people and I shoot over people... for the smaller point guards, they don't really get to contest me."" The Taft graduate stood 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) by the end of the season.Dinwiddie continued to act as the leader of the Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball team through the beginning of his junior year. He helped the team win 14 of their first 16 regular season games, which made them one of the most successful underdogs in the country, most notably toppling the Kansas Jayhawks due to a game-winner from Askia Booker. Dinwiddie was considered the catalyst for the unanticipated run from his team, however. On November 21, 2012, he shot a career-best 14-for-15 from the free throw line against Santa Barbara. Colorado won each game in which their top scorer scored 20 or more points total. On January 12, 2014, Dinwiddie suffered a career-threatening ACL injury against Washington, forcing him to sit out for the remainder of the season. As his junior season was cut short, the team finished the year just 23–12; their record was 14–2 while Dinwiddie was healthy. Dinwiddie reportedly made contact with Russ Paine, who helped Adrian Peterson recover from his ACL injury and become the 2012 NFL MVP. On April 24, 2014, Dinwiddie declared for the NBA draft, foregoing his final year of college eligibility. Dinwiddie was selected with the 38th overall pick by the Detroit Pistons in the 2014 NBA draft. He appeared in 34 games for the Pistons as a rookie, making one start and receiving two assignments to the Grand Rapids Drive, the Pistons' D-League affiliate. His lone start came on February 20, 2015, after a pair of trades left the Pistons short-handed. He had career highs of 12 points and nine assists in a 100–91 win over the Chicago Bulls. Eight days later, he scored a season-best 20 points to go with eight assists in 25 minutes off the bench in a 99–95 loss to the Washington Wizards. The 2015–16 season saw Dinwiddie appear in just 12 regular-season games for the Pistons, after spending the majority of the season in the D-League with the Grand Rapids Drive. After back-up Steve Blake opened the season in a miserable shooting slump, Dinwiddie received his first opportunity of the season in the tenth game, scoring 17 points on November 15 in a 97–85 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. However, after struggling in the next four games, he fell out of the rotation, compounded by Blake's form improvement and Brandon Jennings returning from injury. Dinwiddie played a season-high 29 minutes in the Pistons' regular-season finale on April 13, scoring 12 points in a 112–110 overtime win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He then appeared in game two of the Pistons' 4–0 first-round playoff series loss to the Cavaliers. On June 17, 2016, Dinwiddie was traded to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Cameron Bairstow. He was waived by the Bulls on July 7, re-signed on July 28, and waived again on October 21 after appearing in five preseason games. He then spent the start of the 2016–17 season with Chicago's D-League affiliate team, the Windy City Bulls, averaging 19.4 points, 8.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds over 37.4 minutes in nine games. On December 8, 2016, Dinwiddie signed with the Brooklyn Nets. On February 15, 2017, he scored 15 of his season-high 19 points in the fourth quarter of the Nets' 129–125 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On April 8, 2017, in a 107–106 win over the Chicago Bulls, Dinwiddie made four free throws in the final 13.6 seconds and finished with 19 points. On October 25, 2017, Dinwiddie scored a career-high 22 points and hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with 43 seconds left to lift the Nets to a 112–107 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. On October 29, he tied his career high with 22 points in a 124–111 loss to the Denver Nuggets. On November 17, he set a new career high with 25 points in a 118–107 win over the Utah Jazz. On December 14, he had 26 points in a 111–104 loss to the New York Knicks. On December 23, he tied his career high with 26 points in a 123–119 overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers. On January 3, 2018, he made the go-ahead jumper with 10.1 seconds left and tied his career high with 26 points, leading Brooklyn to a 98–97 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. On January 8, he set a new career high with 31 points in a 114–113 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors. On January 12, he recorded a near triple-double with 20 points, 10 assists and nine rebounds in a 110–105 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On January 17, he had a career-high 13 assists in a 100–95 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. On February 17, Dinwiddie won the Skills Challenge at All-Star Weekend.

The following day, he signed a reported three-year, $34 million contract extension with the Nets. On December 26, he had 37 points and 11 assists off the bench in a 134–132 double-overtime win over the Charlotte Hornets. It was his third 30-point game off the bench, matching the franchise record set by Clifford T. Robinson in 1980–81. On January 16, 2019, he scored 25 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter and overtime of the Nets' 145–142 win over the Houston Rockets. On January 23, he scored a game-high 29 points in a 114–110 win over the Orlando Magic, thus scoring at least 25 points off the bench in 10 games, matching a franchise single-season record—Bubbles Hawkins set the mark during the Nets' inaugural NBA season in 1976–77. Two days later, it was revealed that a right thumb injury that he had originally hurt roughly two months earlier and had gotten progressively worse would require surgery, having suffered torn ligaments. He underwent surgery on January 28. He returned to action on March 1 after missing 14 games, scoring 15 points off the bench in a 123–112 loss to the Hornets. With 28 points against the Cavaliers on March 6, Dinwiddie had his 14th 20-point game off the bench to set a Nets single-season record—Darryl Dawkins, Purvis Short and Orlando Woolridge all had 13. With 23 points against the Hawks on March 9, Dinwiddie surpassed Armen Gilliam in 1993–94 with the most single-season points in a reserve role. On January 28, 2020, Dinwiddie switched his jersey number from 8 to 26 after the approval of the NBA, in honor of the late Kobe Bryant.

A Slovenian international, Dončić made his senior debut for Slovenia in 2016 at only 17 years of age; he would later be named to the All-Tournament Team after helping his country win its first EuroBasket title in 2017.

He played a variety of sports in his childhood, including football, which he later quit after growing too tall. At age seven, he began playing organized basketball at primary school in Ljubljana. His opponents at the time were up to ten years old, as Dončić reflected: ""I was always training and playing with older kids who had much more experience than me. Many of them were bigger and faster than me too, so I had to beat them with my brain."" He admired Greek basketball player Vassilis Spanoulis from his early teenage years, stating that he was ""enchanted"" by him. He wore the number 7 at Real Madrid in honor of Spanoulis. Dončić also grew up admiring American basketball player, LeBron James. When Dončić was eight, his father started playing for his hometown club Union Olimpija, and Olimpija Basketball School coach Grega Brezovec invited Luka to practice with players of his age. Dončić was initially expected to practice with players his age, but only 16 minutes into his first training session, the coaching staff moved him up to the 11-year-old group. Starting in the next session, he primarily practiced with Olimpija's under-14 team, but due to league rules, he only played for the club's under-12 selection team, coming off the bench against opponents three or four years older than him.

Dallas Mavericks executive Donnie Nelson lauded his ""point forward ability,"" and sports website The Ringer labeled him a ""legitimate point guard with the size of a small-ball power forward."" Since his early years with Real Madrid, Dončić was tabbed as one of Europe's premier talents, with Spanish newspaper Marca giving him the nickname ""El Niño Maravilla"" (Wonder Boy). Entering the 2018 NBA draft, he was widely seen as one of the best and most accomplished European prospects of his generation. Slam magazine considered Dončić the ""best international prospect ever,""and sports website SB Nation called him ""most accomplished NBA prospect in decades.""

His basketball IQ, intangibles, and skills have been considered his primary assets, and he is seen as an elite facilitator, especially on the pick and roll. NBA and EuroLeague coach Ettore Messina called him ""phenomenal, especially mentally"" for his age. His lack of lateral quickness to stay in front most NBA point guards and wings has been labeled as one of his main flaws as a player. Dallas Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle refuted some of the worries regarding Dončić's athleticism, stating that ""for a 19-year-old, he's got a really unusual combination of size, speed, and deceptive quickness."" By his sophomore year, Lukas' ability to accelerate off a pick and blow by defenders to get to the basket is seen as one of his strengths. Prior to his draft, basketball journalist and scout, Austin Green, compared Dončić to NBA players Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson. Dončić compared himself to Ben Simmons due to his versatility. In his second season, LA Clippers coach, Doc Rivers, when asked about Dončić stated that ""there's a lot of people in him."" He likened Dončić’s stepback 3-pointers to James Harden, his passing ability to Larry Bird and his court vision to LeBron James. NBA analyst, Kendrick Perkins, called him ""baby LeBron"" due to his overall skill and dominance on the court. In December 2019, San Antonio Spurs coach, Gregg Popovich, called Dončić's playing style ""Magic Johnson-like"" because ""he sees the floor in that same way."" Note: The EuroLeague is not the only competition in which the player participated for the team during the season. He also played in domestic competition, and regional competition if applicable. Dončić can speak four languages: Slovenian, Serbian, English, and Spanish. He learned Spanish after joining Real Madrid.

6719,1148,Kevin Durant,Kevin Wayne Durant,F-G,6-10,240.0,September 29 1988,"Washington, District of Columbia",True,/players/d/duranke01.html,3.0,[10],"Kevin Wayne Durant (born September 29, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played one season of college basketball for the University of Texas, and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018. Durant was a heavily recruited high school prospect who was widely regarded as the second-best player in his class. In college, he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. As a professional, he has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and two Olympic gold medals. Durant has also been selected to nine All-NBA teams and ten NBA All-Star teams. Off the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to The Players' Tribune as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film Thunderstruck. Durant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,to Wanda (née Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.Durant and his siblings grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C.He was unusually tall from a young age, and reached 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) in height while still in middle school (age 13–14).Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors,which included his favorite player, Vince Carter.He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future NBA players Michael Beasley, Greivis Vásquez, and Ty Lawson, the first of whom Durant remains friends with to this day. During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35. After playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing 5 inches (13 cm) before the start of the season and beginning the year at 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m). Prior to the start of the season, he committed to the University of Texas. At the end of the year, he was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, as well as the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game. He was widely regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006. For the 2006–07 college season, Durant—who had grown to 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)—averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game for the Texas Longhorns as a student at the University of Texas.The Longhorns finished the year with a 25–10 record overall and a 12–4 record in conference. Awarded a fourth seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won their first round match-up against New Mexico State but were upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant. For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award, the Naismith College Player of the Year Award, and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards. This made Durant the first freshman to win any of the national player of the year awards. Following the season, he declared for the NBA draft. His #35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns. Durant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds and three steals against the Denver Nuggets. On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks. At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year following averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only teenagers in league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season. Following Durant's debut season, the SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors – blue, orange, and yellow. The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years. At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, Durant set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points. By the conclusion of the year, he had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game,and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting. Durant continued to grow during his first few years in the NBA, finally reaching a height of 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m). During the 2009–10 season, Durant was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game.Behind his play, the Thunder improved their record by 27 wins from the previous year and defied expectations to make the playoffs. With a scoring average of 30.1 points per game, Durant became the youngest NBA scoring champion and was selected to his first All-NBA team. In his playoff debut, he scored 24 points in a Game 1 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers. Oklahoma City would go on to lose the series in six games, but the team's performance led many analysts to label them as an upcoming title contender. Prior to the start of the 2010–11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86 million. For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game. Behind Durant's leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games. On February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets. At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. Durant finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title. Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed.

Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the Finals. For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate. With a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012–13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club. Finishing the year with a 60–22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason. Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility, averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs,but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games. In January of the 2013–14 season, Durant averaged 35.9 points per game while scoring 30 or more points in 12 straight games, including a career-high 54 points against the Golden State Warriors. In April, he surpassed Michael Jordan's record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more at 41. The Thunder finished the year with 59 wins and Durant was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player behind averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. To begin the first round of the playoffs, he struggled against the physical play of the Grizzlies, converting on only 24 percent of his field goals in Game 4. Through five games, the Thunder trailed the series 3–2, prompting The Oklahoman to dub Durant ""Mr. Unreliable"". He responded by scoring 36 points in a Game 6 victory. Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers before losing to the Spurs in the Conference Finals in six games. Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks. He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors, returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points. He then sprained his left big toe in late January. On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot, and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery. In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.To begin the 2015–16 season, Durant and Russell Westbrook reached several historical milestones together, including becoming the first pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points in a single game since 1996, doing so in a win over the Orlando Magic on October 30. On April 11, Durant scored 34 points against the Lakers, setting an NBA record for consecutive games scoring 20 or more points with 64. For the year, Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game,leading the Thunder to 55 wins and the third seed in the West. In Game 2 of the first round of the playoffs against the Mavericks, he scored 21 points but converted only 7 out of 33 shots in the worst postseason shooting performance, both by percentage and number of misses, of his career. After defeating Dallas, Oklahoma City moved on to face the Spurs in the second round, falling behind 2–1 to start the series. In Game 4, Durant tied his playoff career high with 41 points in a Thunder win. Oklahoma City eventually defeated the Spurs in six games, drawing a matchup with the record-setting 73-win Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals. Despite going up 3–1, the Thunder were ousted in seven games, with Durant providing 27 points in Game 7. On July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Warriors in The Players' Tribune. The move was received negatively by the public and NBA analysts, with many comparing it to LeBron James's 2010 off-season departure from the Cleveland Cavaliers to join the Heat. Although many perceive it as much worse than LeBron James's decision to go to the Heat because Kevin Durant decided to go to an already established team that had already won championships. Many referred to him as a ""snake"". On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year. Reflecting on the move for Sports Illustrated, Ben Golliver wrote, ""He chose an ideal roster fit and a shot at playing for the highest-scoring offense the NBA has seen in decades. He chose life alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, and he chose to go against Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green, two elite defenders, in practices rather than in Western Conference finals games."" Durant made his debut for the Warriors on October 25 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring a team-high 27 points in a blowout loss. On November 26, he recorded 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and a career-high six blocked shots in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the first player in team history to finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and five blocks in a single game. On February 11, in his first game back in Oklahoma City since leaving for Golden State, Durant scored 34 points while being booed throughout the night as he helped the Warriors defeat the Thunder for the third time that year. In March, Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise, which forced him to miss the final 19 games of the season. Golden State finished the year with a 67–15 record and entered the playoffs as the first seed. Durant returned from injury in time for the playoffs and helped the Warriors advance to their third consecutive Finals, while also becoming the first team in league history to start the postseason 12–0. In Game 1 of the series, Durant had 38 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists to lead the Warriors past LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers. Durant then helped the Warriors go up 3–0 in the series with a 31-point effort in Game 3, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds left in regulation. In Game 5, he scored 39 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in a series-clinching win. For the Finals, Durant was the Golden State's top scorer in every game, averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists while shooting 55.5 percent from the field, 47.4 percent from three-point range, and 92.7 percent from the free throw line. He was subsequently named the NBA Finals MVP. After the Finals, Durant declined his $27.7 million player option and became an unrestricted free agent. On July 25, he re-signed with the Warriors for less money than the maximum, which helped the franchise create enough salary cap space to keep their core roster intact and add free agents. On January 10 of the 2017–18 season, Durant scored 40 points in a loss to the Clippers, becoming the second-youngest player in league history to reach the 20,000-point milestone. On January 23, he registered a career-high 14 assists in a win over the New York Knicks. On February 14, he scored a season-high 50 points in a loss to the Trail Blazers. In March, he missed games with a fractured rib, joining teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson on the sidelines for the back-end of the season. Golden State eventually finished the year with 58 wins and Durant set a career high for blocks in season with 119. In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Durant scored 37 points in a win over the higher-seeded Houston Rockets. Through six games, the Warriors found themselves trailing 3–2, and Durant was criticized for contributing to Golden State's struggles by playing too much in isolation. The Warriors staved off elimination in Game 6, and in Game 7, Durant scored 34 points, helping Golden State return to the Finals with a series-clinching victory. In Game 3 of the Finals, Durant recorded a playoff career-high 43 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a win over the Cavaliers, leading the Warriors to a 3–0 advantage. Golden State ultimately swept Cleveland and clinched a second straight championship; with averages of 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists, Durant also won his second Finals MVP Award. On July 7, 2018, Durant re-signed with the Warriors, on a reported two-year, $61.5 million contract, which included a player option for the second year. During an overtime loss to the Clippers on November 12, 2018, Green cursed out Durant over his upcoming free agency status after the season, and he was suspended for the much-publicized blowup. On November 29, Durant scored a season-high 51 points in a 131–128 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors, thus scoring 40 or more in his third straight game. With Curry and Green sidelined for most of November, the Warriors finished the month with a 15–8 record and five straight road losses, after starting the season at 10–1. In Game 5 of the first round of the playoffs, he scored a playoff career-high 45 points in a 129–121 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. In Game 6, he set a new playoff career high with 50 points in a 129–110 win to close out the series. During Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets, Durant suffered a right calf strain, subsequently missing Game 6, in which the Warriors won the series, as well as the entire Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, which the Warriors won in a four-game sweep. After missing nine games with the strained right calf, Durant returned to action in Game 5 of the 2019 finals against Toronto, and scored 11 points in the first quarter. However, he was lost for the game two minutes into the second quarter when he tried to drive by former teammate Serge Ibaka and suffered an Achilles tendon injury, falling and grabbing his lower right calf. He limped off the court and was helped to the locker room. The Warriors won the game to cut the Raptors' series lead to 3–2. The Warriors went on to lose the NBA Finals in Game 6, ending their quest for a three-peat. On June 30, Durant announced that he planned to sign with the Brooklyn Nets after the July moratorium ended on July 6. On July 1, Golden State CEO Joe Lacob announced that Durant's No. 35 will no longer be issued by the Warriors. Durant signed with Brooklyn on July 7, 2019, in a sign-and-trade deal. In February 2007, Durant received an invitation to the United States national team training camp. Despite a strong performance, he was cut from the team when its roster was trimmed to its twelve-player limit. Coach Mike Krzyzewski cited the experience of the remaining players as the deciding factor in making the cut. Durant was finally selected to the national team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and became their leader as other All-Stars were unavailable, a role he downplayed. At the tournament, he led Team USA to its first FIBA World Championship since 1994, earning tournament MVP honors in the process. His final averages for the competition were 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in nine games. At the 2012 Olympics, Durant set the record for total points scored in an Olympic basketball tournament. With averages of 19.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game, he helped the national team go undefeated en route to a gold medal. In the tournament's final game, he led all scorers with 30 points. Less than a month before the start of the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, Durant announced that he would be dropping out of the competition, citing mental and physical exhaustion as reasons for his departure. He rejoined Team USA in 2016 for the Olympics, where he led them to a gold medal. In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career. Durant's height is officially 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) and his primary position is small forward. His career averages are 27.1 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game.Widely regarded as one of the best players of his generation, Durant has earned All-NBA honors eight times (2009–2014, 2016–2018) and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.He has also won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting three times, a trend that he has expressed frustration over. Durant is best known for his prodigious scoring ability. From 2010 to 2014, he won four scoring titles, becoming one of only two players to win four scoring titles in a five-year span. Early in his career, his playing style was isolation-driven, but he quickly developed into an excellent off-ball player who was capable of scoring from the outside as well. By 2013, he was shooting at a historically-great clip, which helped him become one of only seven members of the 50–40–90 club. This ability to impact the offense in a variety of ways helped Durant remain effective and improve an already elite offense upon joining the Warriors in 2016. Throughout his career, his height and 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan have created matchup problems for defenses as he is able to get off a clean shot regardless of the situation. Upon beating his man or gaining momentum, he also becomes a strong finisher at the rim; for example, he converted 72.2% of shots in the paint in 2012. Early in Durant's career, he was criticized for his slim build, defense, and passing. Over time, he grew as a playmaker, increasing his assist numbers every year from 2010 to 2014, though his overall vision still lagged behind the league's best passers'. He also showed defensive improvement, with opponents averaging just .62 points per isolation play against him in 2014, the best success rate for defensive players who faced at least 100 isolations that season. Upon going to Golden State, he developed into a more reliable off-ball defender and rim protector, and in 2018 was considered for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. Durant is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie The Real MVP: The Wanda Pratt Story. During his time with the Thunder, Durant described himself as a ""high school kid"" who enjoys playing video games in his spare time. A Christian, Durant has religious tattoos on his stomach, wrist, and back. He owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013. That same year, he opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player.

Durant has admitted to feeling more genuine in Golden State as opposed to Oklahoma City, where he was ""just trying to please everybody"". Throughout his career, Durant has participated in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross for the victims of the 2013 Moore tornado. His generosity inspired the Thunder and Nike to match his donation. He is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D. C. branch of P'Tones Records, a nationwide non-profit after-school music program. In 2017, Durant became involved with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement. On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it. In his first vlog, he detailed, ""I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube."" As of June 2019, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 760,000 subscribers and 31 million video views. On February 13, 2018, Deadline reported that Durant, in partnership with producer Brian Grazer's Imagine Television, will create a basketball-themed scripted drama for Apple.",25554,1148,2018-19,78.0,78.0,2702.0,9.6,18.4,0.521,1.8,5.2,0.353,7.8,13.3,0.587,6.0,6.7,0.885,0.4,6.2,6.6,6.1,0.8,1.1,3.0,2.1,27.0,3.0,Brooklyn Nets

After one year of college basketball with the Kansas Jayhawks, he was drafted with the third overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the 76ers. Multiple foot and knee injuries delayed his debut for two seasons until 2016–17, when he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team despite playing only 31 games. Embiid has received three All-Star selections. He has nicknamed himself ""The Process"" in response to a refrain from 76ers fans during the Sam Hinkie era to ""trust the process"".Embiid was born in Yaoundé, Cameroon, to military officer Thomas Embiid and his wife, Christine. He originally planned to play professional volleyball in Europe but started playing basketball at age 15, modeling his game after NBA Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon. Embiid was discovered at a basketball camp by Luc Mbah a Moute, a fellow native of Yaounde and an NBA player. With Mbah a Moute as his mentor, Embiid moved to the United States at age 16 to devote himself to becoming a professional basketball player.

He played two years of Division 1 college basketball for Long Beach State, where he became a standout as a senior, earning Big West Player of the Year honors. After being selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the second round of the 2013 NBA draft, Ennis moved to Australia and joined the Perth Wildcats. There he won an NBL championship and became a Perth favorite.He returned to the United States in 2014 in pursuit of an NBA contract, and subsequently joined the Miami Heat. He went on to spend time with the Memphis Grizzlies and the New Orleans Pelicans during the 2015–16 season, as well as in the NBA Development League with the Iowa Energy. He re-joined the Grizzlies in July 2016, and was traded to the Pistons in February 2018. He then split the 2018–19 season with the Houston Rockets and the Philadelphia 76ers. Born in Ventura, California, Ennis grew up in the Westview Village housing project where he and his five siblings played basketball, soccer, rode bikes and skateboarded. As a youngster, he and his family moved around a lot—Ennis attended three different high schools in his freshman year alone. They later settled back down at Westview Village where he went on to graduate from Ventura High School in 2009.As a freshman at Oxnard College in 2009–10, Ennis was named first-team All-WSC after averaging 19.0 points, the third most in the state by a freshman, and 7.7 rebounds per game. For his sophomore season, he returned home to play for Ventura College, and in 2010–11, he was named first-team All-California Community College Athletic Association and first-team All-Western State Conference after averaging 20.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.6 steals per game. He scored 1,053 points in two seasons of junior college basketball, while scoring in double figures in 48 of his 52 games.For his junior season, Ennis joined the Long Beach State 49ers,and immediately garnered the starting small forward role. In 2011–12, Ennis earned honorable mention All-Big West Conference honorsafter averaging 10.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.6 steals per game.With the departure of conference player of the year Casper Ware, Ennis became the go-to player for the 49ers in 2012–13. He responded by averaging 16.5 points and 6.7 rebounds per game while leading the 49ers to another regular-season Big West championship. At the end of the season, Ennis was named Big West Player of the Yearand an AP honorable mention All-American.On April 5, 2013, Ennis scored a team-high 13 points in the Reese's College All-Star Game, leading the East team to an 87–81 win over the West. On June 27, 2013, Ennis was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 50th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft. His rights were subsequently traded to the Miami Heat on draft night, and he later joined the Heat for the 2013 NBA Summer League. The Heat reportedly wanted Ennis to play for their NBA Development League affiliate team, the Sioux Falls Skyforce, in 2013–14 but were unable to sign him to the NBA minimum salary of USD$490,180 due to salary cap restrictions. Consequently, the most Ennis would have earned playing in the D-League was USD$25,000, so Ennis made the decision to play overseas in order to support his father, his disabled mother, and his five siblings. On August 10, 2013, Ennis signed with the Perth Wildcats for the 2013–14 NBL season. He quickly became an excitement machine in Perth playing alongside fellow import Jermaine Beal. His NBL debut on October 11, 2013 lived up to the hype as the talented swingman did a bit of everything—dunks, blocked shots, assists and jump shots—on his way to 25 points, four rebounds and two assists in an 83–80 win over the Adelaide 36ers. His 25 points marked the most points scored by a Wildcat on debut. Ennis went on to earn Player of the Month honors for October after averaging a league-leading 24.0 points per game, and was also in the league's top ten for rebounds with 6.8 per game. The Wildcats dominated the early season proceedings, earning an 8–0 record thanks to the play of Ennis. His high-flying dunks and athleticism rocked the league as he proved to be a top MVP candidate alongside Wollongong Hawks point guard Rotnei Clarke and Melbourne Tigers shooting guard Chris Goulding. On November 30, 2013, he scored a season-high 33 points in an 85–75 win over the Cairns Taipans. The Wildcats finished the 2013–14 regular season with a league-best 21–7 record. On March 28, 2014, Ennis played in his first playoff game—Game 1 of the Wildcats' semi-final series against the Wollongong Hawks. In just under 32 minutes of action, he scored a game-high 25 points, 14 of which came in the third quarter, to help the Wildcats defeat the Hawks 91–79. Two days later, Ennis' 20-point performance in Game 2 helped the Wildcats claim a 2–0 series sweep, advancing them to the NBL Grand Final. In Game 1 of the grand final series against the Adelaide 36ers on April 7, Ennis scored a game-high 30 points in leading the Wildcats to a 92–85 win in Perth. In Game 2 on April 11 in Adelaide, Ennis endured a quieter-than-usual night, tallying just 14 points before fouling out with 22 seconds left in the contest. The 36ers subsequently leveled the series at 1–1 with an 89–84 win, sending the grand final to a deciding Game 3 in Perth on April 13. In Game 3, Ennis' early foul trouble limited him to a season-low nine points, but thanks to teammate Jermaine Beal picking up the slack, the Wildcats claimed a comfortable 93–59 victory to win the championship. Prior to Game 1 of the grand final series, Ennis finished third in the MVP voting behind Rotnei Clarke (winner) and Chris Goulding, and earned All-NBL First Team honors. At the Wildcats MVP Ball, Ennis was crowned the Gordon Ellis Medalist as the club's Most Valuable Player for the 2013–14 season. Ennis appeared in all 33 games for the Wildcats in 2013–14, averaging 21.2 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game whilst shooting 46.8% from the field. Following the conclusion of the 2013–14 NBL season, Ennis moved to Puerto Rico, where he joined Piratas de Quebradillas for the 2014 BSN season. He appeared in 12 games for the club before returning to the United States in June to attend various NBA workouts. Over those 12 games, he averaged 16.6 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. On July 15, 2014, Ennis signed a multi-year deal with the Miami Heat. He impressed during the 2014 NBA Summer League, averaging 15.5 points, 5.7 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.3 steals in six games. On October 29, 2014, Ennis made his NBA debut in the Heat's 107–95 season-opening win over the Washington Wizards. With the Heat up by four points with less than nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter, Ennis brought the American Airlines Arena crowd to their feet with a spectacular three-point play, taking off from midway down the paint, elevating over Rasual Butler and throwing down a dunk while getting fouled. He finished the game with five points and two rebounds in 14½ minutes of action off the bench. He went on to record a then season-best game on December 21 with 16 points and 8 rebounds in a 100–84 win over the Boston Celtics. On March 29, 2015, Ennis tied his season high of 16 points in a 109–102 win over the Detroit Pistons. On April 5, he topped his season high, recording 17 points and 5 rebounds in a loss to the Indiana Pacers. In the Heat's season finale on April 15, Ennis received just his third start of the season with the majority of his teammates sitting out. He played the entire game and finished with 17 points, 12 rebounds and 6 assists in a 105–101 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The Heat missed the playoffs in 2014–15 with a 37–45 record, good for 10th in the Eastern Conference. Ennis appeared in 62 of the Heat's 82 games during his rookie season, averaging 5.0 points and 2.8 rebounds in 17.0 minutes per game. With $845,059 guaranteed salary on the line for Ennis coming into the 2015–16 season, he struggled during the 2015 NBA Summer League, calling his play ""terrible"" after shooting 29.7 percent from the field (19-of-64) in seven games, including 2-of-23 on three-pointers, and recorded more than twice as many turnovers (23) as assists (11). Tendinitis in his knees contributed to his struggles, but with three months between summer league and training camp, Ennis was able to rejuvenate himself while receiving treatment that subsided the tendinitis. He also worked on his jump shot with Heat assistant coach Keith Smart, and focused on improving his ball-handling. Despite sustaining a dislocated finger on his left hand in Miami's exhibition finale against the New Orleans Pelicans, the Heat retained Ennis for the 2015–16 season after earning a spot on the team's opening night roster. Ennis managed game time in three of the Heat's first seven games to begin the 2015–16 season, when on November 10, 2015, he and Mario Chalmers were traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Jarnell Stokes and Beno Udrih, a deal undertaken in order for the Heat to cut $6 million in luxury tax. Upon joining the Grizzlies, Ennis was unable to make an impact or string together consecutive games due to the team's strong contingent of wing players in Jeff Green, Matt Barnes, Tony Allen, JaMychal Green and Vince Carter. He subsequently spent the majority of the 2015–16 season in the NBA Development League playing for the Iowa Energy, the Grizzlies' affiliate team. In his debut for the Energy on December 5, he scored a season-high 32 points in a 116–93 win over the Canton Charge. On March 2, 2016, after appearing in just 10 games for Memphis, he was waived by the organization. On March 6, 2016, Ennis was acquired by the Iowa Energy. He played for the Energy that afternoon, recording 30 points and 7 rebounds in a 109–104 loss to the Delaware 87ers. On March 16, he recorded his first double-double of the season with 24 points and 10 rebounds in a 106–102 win over the Erie BayHawks. Two days later, he had a season-best game with 30 points, 13 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 steals in a 123–106 win over the Maine Red Claws. Between March 12 and 26, Ennis helped Iowa win six straight games to bring them back into playoff contention. However, a loss to the Sioux Falls Skyforce on March 29 ended their streak, as they were eliminated from the playoff race with two games remaining in the season. In 24 games for Iowa during the 2015–16 season, he averaged 18.8 points, 6.0 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.0 steals in 33.4 minutes per game. On March 30, 2016, Ennis signed a 10-day contract with the New Orleans Pelicans to help the team deal with numerous injuries. New Orleans had to use an NBA hardship exemption in order to sign him as he made their roster stand at 18, three over the allowed limited of 15. He made his debut for the Pelicans later that night, recording 13 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists in 24 minutes off the bench in a 100–92 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.

On April 11, he scored a career-high 29 points on 9-of-14 shooting in a 121–116 loss to the Chicago Bulls. In the Pelicans' season finale on April 13, Ennis scored 28 points in a 144–109 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. On July 13, 2016, Ennis signed a two-year, $6 million contract with the Memphis Grizzlies, returning to the franchise for a second stint. In the Grizzlies' season opener on October 26, 2016, Ennis recorded 15 points and six rebounds in 28 minutes as a starter in a 102–98 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Four days later, he scored eight points and tied a career high with 12 rebounds in a 112–103 overtime win over the Washington Wizards. On November 2, 2016, he had a season-best game with 16 points and 10 rebounds in an 89–83 win over his former team, the New Orleans Pelicans. Ennis started in 13 of the Grizzlies' first 14 games before missing his first game of the season on November 23 against the Philadelphia 76ers due to a calf injury. He missed 14 games in total with a right calf injury, returning to action on December 18 against the Utah Jazz. For the season, he appeared in 64 games and averaged 6.7 points on 37.2 percent shooting from three-point range, four rebounds, 0.7 steals and 23.5 minutes per game.

On March 2, 2018, he scored a season-high 21 points in a 115–106 overtime loss to the Orlando Magic.

Ennis missed three games to finish October with a right hamstring strain. On November 15, he scored a season-high 19 points against the Golden State Warriors. After starting in 22 games to start the season, Ennis came off the bench for the first time on December 11 against the Portland Trail Blazers, but left the game with a strained right hamstring. He subsequently missed the next 10 games. On February 7, 2019, Ennis was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, with Houston receiving the right to swap 2021 second-round picks with the 76ers. He became a key part of Philadelphia's rotation to finish the regular season and during the playoffs. In Game 2 of the 76ers' second-round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors, Ennis scored 13 points in a 94–89 win. At the season's end, he declined his player option for the 2019–20 season.

On June 22, 2017, Fox was selected with the fifth overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings. On July 8, 2017, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Kings. During four games of the 2017 NBA Summer League, Fox averaged 11.8 points, 3 assists and 2.3 steals while playing 21.3 minutes per game. Fox made his NBA debut for the Kings in their season opener on October 18, 2017, against the Houston Rockets, where he scored 14 points, 4 rebounds, and 5 assist in 24-plus minutes in a 105-100 loss. On October 23, 2017, Fox recorded a career-high 19 points, 4 assist, 5 rebounds, and 3 steals in a 117-115 loss against the Phoenix Suns.

On January 28, 2018, Fox scored a season-high 26 points, going 6-6 from three-point range in a 15-point loss to the San Antonio Spurs. On February 14, Fox was named Lonzo Ball's replacement for the Rising Stars Challenge. On November 1, 2018, during a 146-115 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Fox notched his first career triple-double with 31 points, 10 rebounds, and 15 assists to bring the Kings to a 6-3 record, becoming the only player after LeBron James in 2005 to score a 30-point triple double before the age of 21. Fox drastically improved during the 2018-2019 season. Not only did he improve in every major statistical category (Including his points per game from 11.6 to 17.3 and assists per game from 4.4 to 7.3), He also finished top 3 and was nominated for the NBA Most Improved Player Award, finishing second to Pascal Siakam of the 2019 NBA Champion Toronto Raptors. This improvement had been a rejuvenating feeling for the Sacramento Kings , seeing as Fox had not lived up to the initial hype in his rookie season being the 5th overall pick in 2017.  Listed at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) & 185 pounds (84 kg), Fox has primarily played the point guard position throughout his career. He is left-handed. Coming of out Kentucky, Fox was highly regarded among scouts for his quickness, speed, & athleticism. These attributes combined make Fox one of the most dangerous players on the fast break & driving to the rim. Fox has elite ability to explode by defenders, either finishing at the rim or distributing to a teammate. Fox is a high end finisher at the rim being able to use his body control & leaping ability to finish layups & draw fouls. Fox is also capable at scoring off floaters or mid range pull ups while driving. Fox is considered to be an average 3 point shooter averaging 34% of his career as of December 2019 but has shown potential to develop a good shooter. Fox has also developed into a dangerous facilitator in his second season, averaging 7.3 assist per game. Most of his assists come from running the pick and roll where his playmaking versatility & dexterity allows him to either throw an alley-oop or bounce pass to the roll man or kick it outside for a jump shot on the perimeter if the defense rotates. He also generates a-lot of his assists running the fast break. On defense, Fox can be exploited by bigger guards because of his small frame but shows a great knack for intercepting passes & making quick rotations due to his elite quickness & 6 foot 7 inch wingspan. Fox is also a good on ball defender with fast, active hands that can frustrate ball-handlers & has great ability to elude & avoid screens to stay on his man. Fox was born to his parents Aaron and Lorainne Harris-Fox and has one brother named Quentin Fox. Fox goes by the nicknames “Fox”, “Swipa”, and “Swipa da Fox”. Fox chose the number zero at Kentucky because he “fears no one”, giving his original number five to teammate Malik Monk.According to his high school coach, Fox would come to school at 6 AM and come to practice in the gym every morning. Fox would sleep on the couch almost every night and play the NBA 2K video game series. This, according to his father, is one of the reasons he has developed into the player that he is today.",26266,1366,2019-20,37.0,35.0,1169.0,8.2,17.3,0.471,1.2,3.7,0.322,7.0,13.6,0.511,5.1,7.6,0.675,0.8,3.9,4.7,7.9,1.7,0.6,3.7,3.3,22.6,26.0,Sacramento Kings

He played college basketball for the Washington Huskies before joining the NBA. During his single season (2016–17) with the Huskies, Fultz played point guard and shooting guard. Despite Washington's relatively disappointing year, he was named to the third-team All-American and to the first-team All-Pac-12. He was then selected by the Philadelphia 76ers as the consensus first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft. Fultz was born in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, the younger of two children. His father abandoned the family, so he relied heavily on his mother, Ebony.Impassioned by basketball, Fultz was mentored in his early years by a local instructor named Keith Williams. In 2012, he began attending DeMatha Catholic High, an all-boys prep school as well as basketball powerhouse. He had shown promise on the DeMatha Stags' freshman team; but as a sophomore, the 5-foot-9-inch (1.75 m) guard was cut from the varsity roster.He was overlooked due to his awkward gait, having the appearance of ""Bambi""; as assistant coach Cory McCrae explained, ""He was long and lanky, and he’d walk and his knees would be hurting"". However, Fultz outplayed the competition at the junior varsity level, making it apparent that he did not belong there.Assistant coach Raphael Chillious of the Washington Huskies was the first to notice Fultz's potential, describing him as an athlete with the makings of an NBA All-Star-caliber player if he continued to grow. At the start of his junior season, Fultz stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m).As a starter for DeMatha's varsity team, he averaged 16.8 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game and was named the Player of the Year in the highly-competitive Washington Catholic Athletic Conference.Among the highlights of his junior campaign were the game-wining foul shots he made in a 16-point performance while being guarded by Jayson Tatum of Chaminade and the triple-double he posted in a matchup against Roselle Catholic at the Hoophall Classic.His recruiting stature abruptly soared during this season, with Rivals.com ranking him number 24 in the Class of 2016 and over 20 college programs offering him scholarships.Before his senior season, Fultz made a verbal commitment on August 21, 2015, to the Washington Huskies.He concluded his high school career with exceptional numbers as he recorded the Stags' single-season record for assists, with 278, and led the team to their second consecutive conference championship.At the McDonald's All-American Game on March 31, 2016, Fultz tallied 10 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists.At the Jordan Brand Classic come April, Fultz accumulated 19 points in a 131–117 East team victory.During the summer, he was selected to Team USA's FIBA Americas Under-18 roster. With Fultz as its leading scorer, the team progressed to the gold medal championship game; and in dominant fashion, Fultz posted 23 points and earned the tournament's MVP award for his performance. By the end of his senior year, Fultz was rated as a five-star recruit and ranked No.7 overall recruit and No.3 guard in the 2016 high school class. The Washington Huskies were fully expecting to open the 2016-17 season with Dejounte Murray and Marquese Chriss; instead, however, both freshmen were selected in the first round of the 2016 NBA draft. Fultz said of the anticipated scenario if they had stayed: ""I think we would be No. 1 in the country. We would have gone to the (NCAA) tournament and won"". Without any proven talent and only one returning starter, Fultz took charge as a team leader and primary scorer. As the starting point guard, he debuted in a 98-90 home game loss to the Yale Bulldogs in which he posted 30 points. Although the Huskies finished with a disappointing 9-22 record, Fultz enjoyed one of the best freshman seasons in all Pac-12 Conference history. In 25 games that season, his 23.2 point average was the highest mark in the Pac-12 in 20 years and second in Huskies history behind Bob Houbregs' 25.6 points per game in 1952-1953. Fultz also led the team in minutes played with 35.7 per game as well as assists with 5.7 per game and was second in rebounds with 5.9 per game. By the time Pac-12 honors were awarded, Fultz—‌the lone Husky selected—‌was named to the First-team All-Pac-12 and Third-team All-American. A player who ""jumps off the page athletically and possesses creative scoring instincts and playmaking skills"", the consensus among sports analysts was that Fultz would be the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft. Fultz was selected as the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, who then finalized his four-year rookie contract on July 8. The 76ers, after years of mediocrity, had lofty expectations of returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2012; such were the high hopes that rested on their new core consisting of Fultz, Joel Embiid, and Ben Simmons. In his first regular season game, on October 18, the rookie posted 10 points, 3 rebounds, and 1 assist in 18 minutes of play coming off the bench. It was not long, however, before a shoulder injury—termed a ""scapular muscle imbalance""—so ravaged his shooting that he shot only 33 perecent from the field and attempted zero three-pointers in four games. In response, the 76ers decided to sit Fultz indefinitely until he recovered. Debate ensued between sports analysts and the organization over how much his shooting woes were of physical versus psychological origin. Fultz himself later clarified: ""What happened  was an injury. Let me get that straight. It was an injury that happened that didn’t allow me to go through the certain paths that I needed to, to shoot the ball."" During his hiatus, Fultz's basic shooting mechanics appeared to change under a trainer from outside the 76ers organization; this and his lengthy recovery period taken were heavily scrutinized. The team's president of basketball operations, Bryan Colangelo, suggested that the rookie might very well sit for the remainder of the season; but on March 26, 2018, it was announced that Fultz would return to the hardwood for an upcoming game against the Denver Nuggets. Despite some missteps, such as one air ball shot and some shots blocked, Fultz put up 10 points and 8 assists in 14 minutes of playing time. On April 11, at 19 years-old, Fultz became the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double, breaking the mark set by fellow rookie Lonzo Ball earlier that season. For the 2018–19 season, head coach Brett Brown named Fultz the starting shooting guard over veteran JJ Redick. Fifteen games into the season, however, Fultz lost the position to Jimmy Butler, whom the 76ers acquired in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Conflicting statements regarding Fultz's health and poor production continued to be sources of conflict and drama for the team. On November 20, 2018, his agent Raymond Brothers announced Fultz would not participate in practice or games until a shoulder injury was evaluated; his ailment was later described as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the neurogenic type of the disorder which “affects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle’s ability to shoot a basketball”. On February 7, 2019, Fultz was traded to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Jonathon Simmons and two draft picks. Magic coach Steve Clifford later stated in March that he did not anticipate Fultz returning to play during the season, stressing that his shoulder injury was indeed ""very serious."" Fultz made his debut for the Magic in the season opener October 23, 2019, scoring 12 points and making the ESPN top plays at number 4 looking comfortable on the court once again.",26270,1405,2019-20,54.0,49.0,1523.0,6.2,13.4,0.465,0.6,2.4,0.27,5.6,11.0,0.508,2.1,2.8,0.75,0.6,3.9,4.4,6.3,1.7,0.2,2.6,2.4,15.2,22.0,Orlando Magic

He played with the Knicks for two and a half seasons before being traded to the Denver Nuggets in 2011. In 2017, he was acquired by the Clippers. His nickname is Gallo, which is Italian for ""rooster"".Gallinari started playing professionally in 2004for Casalpusterlengo, a team in Serie B1 (third level in Italy). In 2005, Gallinari was acquired by Armani Jeans Milano, which then sent him to Edimes Pavia, a team competing in the Italian league second division championship during the 2005–2006 season, so that he could earn more experience with extended playing minutes. Even though he played only half of the season due to an injury, in 2006 he was nominated as the best Italian player of the Italian league second division championship, averaging 14.3 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.0 steals, and 0.8 assists in 17 games.In 2006, he was recalled by Olimpia Milano to play in the 2006–2007 Italian league first division championship and also in the second level tier European wide cup competition, the ULEB Cup (now called EuroCup).

This prompted the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association to review its transfer rules.He began playing basketball for Spalding as a junior in 2002–03, earning first team All-Baltimore Catholic League honors as a junior and senior, and was also honored as the Baltimore Sun's co-player of the year as a senior.He was the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, and a Parade first-team All-American in his senior year after averaging 21.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 3.7 blocks per game.Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Gay was listed as the No. 2 small forward and the No. 5 player in the nation in 2004.Gay's college recruitment and decision to attend the University of Connecticut over the University of Maryland were controversial.Gay had expressed a desire to attend Maryland and said that he grew up rooting for the team, but he ultimately chose UConn. Because of the heavy involvement of an AAU coach and a high school coach, there was the appearance of impropriety, although no NCAA recruiting violations were discovered.The NCAA adopted a new scheduling rule after UConn paid $25,000 to schedule a game against the Beltway Ballers, an ad hoc AAU team that consisted of Gay's former teammates. Although it violated no standing rule at the time, media observers and Connecticut staff considered it directly connected to the recruitment. According to individuals close to Maryland head coach Gary Williams, the recruitment demonstrated that rule bending is often necessary to secure highly touted players, which Williams said he was unwilling to do, even at the expense of recruiting.As a freshman at Connecticut in 2004–05, Gay was a co-winner (with Jeff Green of Georgetown) of the Big East Conference Rookie of the Year award after averaging 11.8 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.5 assists on .462 shooting in 28.8 minutes in 31 games. He was a unanimous Big East All-Rookie Team selection, was named National Freshman of the Year by The Sporting News, and earned Big East Rookie of the Week honors five times. In the summer of 2005, Gay played for United States' Men's Under-21 World Championship Team. He averaged 10.5 points and 5.5 rebounds per game over the tournament. Before his sophomore season began, Gay was nominated as Big East Preseason Player of the Year, along with Syracuse guard Gerry McNamara. After the season concluded, Gay was one of four division one college players nominated for the Naismith College Player of the Year Award (along with J. J. Redick, Adam Morrison and Allan Ray). Also, he was a unanimous selection to the First-team All-Big East. He led the Huskies in scoring (15.2 points) while averaging 6.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 30.8 minutes in 33 games as a sophomore. He was named first-team All-America by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and was named to the 2006 Washington, D.C. Regional All-Tournament Team. He scored a career-high 28 points on November 21, 2005 against Arkansas. Gay led the Huskies to a 30–3 record, and finished his college career with 20 points and six rebounds in a career-high 42 minutes in an NCAA Elite Eight loss to George Mason on March 26. On April 24, 2006, Gay declared for the 2006 NBA draft. In February 2012, Gay was inducted into the ""Huskies of Honor"". Gay was selected with the eighth overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets, who then traded him and Stromile Swift to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Shane Battier on July 12. Gay immediately signed his rookie scale contract with the Grizzlies upon being acquired by the team. Gay averaged 10.8 points, 4.5 rebounds and 27.0 minutes in 78 games (43 starts) as a rookie. He earned NBA Rookie of the Month honors for November 2006, and went on to be selected to the 2006–07 All-Rookie First Team after placing fourth among first-year players in scoring, sixth in rebounding, fifth in steals (0.91), third in blocks (0.95), and fourth in minutes. He also finished third in the balloting for the 2006–07 Rookie of the Year Award behind winner Brandon Roy and runner-up Andrea Bargnani. In 2007–08, Gay's second season, he set a Grizzlies' franchise record for points in a single season (1,632) and established a career high for scoring average (20.1 points), becoming just the third player in franchise history to average 20 points per game (behind only Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Pau Gasol). He participated in the 2008 Rising Stars Slam Dunk Contest, and finished runner-up to Hedo Türkoğlu for the 2007–08 NBA Most Improved Player Award. After his invitation to the 2008 Slam Dunk Contest, Gay and YouTube teamed up for the Rudy Gay Slam Dunk Contest promotion, in which he asked fans to upload footage of their best dunks for him to attempt during the contest. During the contest, he performed a one handed reverse clutch dunk in the first round, and during the second round, teammate Kyle Lowry alley-ooped the ball off the bar and from behind the backboard; Gay regathered and pulled off a windmill dunk. He ended with a score of 85 but did not advance to the second round. In 2008–09, Gay recorded 18.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.24 steals and 37.3 minutes in 79 games (78 starts).

He finished the season tied for 18th in the NBA in scoring, 17th in steals and third in minutes. On July 8, 2010, Gay re-signed with the Memphis Grizzlies to a five-year, $82 million contract. He emerged as one of the league's premier small forwards in 2010–11, posting career highs in seven major statistical categories before missing the final 23 regular season games and all of the 2011 Playoffs due to a left shoulder subluxation sustained on February 15 against the Philadelphia 76ers. He recorded career highs for assists (2.8), steals (1.69), blocks (1.07), field goal percentage (.471), three-point field goal percentage (.396), free throw percentage (.805) and minutes (39.9). He also ranked second on the team in scoring (19.8 points) in 54 games (all starts). Gay watched from the sidelines as the Grizzlies defeated the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs in a first round upset before falling to the Oklahoma City Thunder in seven games in the Western Conference semi-finals. Gay passed Shane Battier (523) as the Grizzlies' all-time leader in steals on February 2, 2012 against the Atlanta Hawks. In 2011–12, Gay led the Grizzlies in scoring (19.0 points) and minutes (37.3), and averaged a career high in rebounding (6.4). He posted 2.3 assists and .455 shooting in 65 games (all starts), and ranked 17th in the NBA in scoring, 16th in steals (1.46), sixth in minutes and seventh in dunks (110). He made his first postseason appearance in 2011–12, averaged a team-high 19.0 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists on .421 shooting in 39.9 minutes in seven games against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the 2012 Western Conference Playoffs. On January 30, 2013, the Grizzlies traded Gay to the Toronto Raptors in a three-team deal that also included the Detroit Pistons. Gay set a franchise record by scoring 74 points in his first three games with the Raptors. The Raptors finished the 2012–13 season with a 34–48 win/loss record and missed the playoffs. He became the first player to lead two teams in scoring in the same season since Stephon Marbury in 2003–04. He averaged 19.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.73 steals and 34.7 minutes in 33 games (32 starts) with Toronto. On December 9, 2013, the Raptors traded Gay, along with Quincy Acy and Aaron Gray, to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Greivis Vásquez, John Salmons, Chuck Hayes and Patrick Patterson. On January 22, 2014, he tied his career high of 41 points in the Kings' 114–97 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. On June 22, 2014, Gay exercised his $19.3 million contract option with the Kings for the 2014–15 season. On October 31, 2014, Gay scored 40 points in a 103–94 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. On November 19, 2014, he signed a three-year, $40 million contract extension with the Kings. Gay appeared in just one of the Kings' final nine games of the 2014–15 season after experiencing headaches due to a concussion he received when he had a collision with his ex-teammate Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies on March 30. Gay had one of his best seasons in the NBA, averaging 21.1 points, 5.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists in 68 games. On November 25, 2015, Gay scored a season-high 36 points in a 129–118 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 15, 2015, he recorded 17 points, 13 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 block and a career-high 6 steals in a 107–97 win over the Houston Rockets.

On July 6, 2017, Gay signed with the San Antonio Spurs. On December 28, 2017, Gay suffered a right heel injury and was subsequently ruled out for at least two weeks. On July 11, 2018, Gay re-signed with the Spurs. In 2010, Gay helped the United States win its first FIBA World Championship gold medal since 1994, averaging 7.0 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 13.4 minutes in nine games for the undefeated Americans. He was also a member of the national team in 2014 that collected the gold medal at the FIBA Basketball World Cup after another undefeated campaign. In 2010, Gay was named an ambassador for the Hoops for St. Jude fundraising program for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and donated $20,000 to the program, which allowed donors to pledge a set amount of dollars for each point scored by Gay and other participating NBA players. In April 2010, Gay was awarded the NBA Cares Community Assist Award for March in recognition of his service to the Memphis community, particularly his ongoing support of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. As a result, a $5,000 donation was given by the NBA on behalf of Gay to support St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Gay, who wore number 22 with Memphis, personally donated $22,222 to the hospital. In 2013, Gay married his longtime girlfriend Ecko Wray.",26279,1464,2019-20,51.0,5.0,1072.0,5.9,13.5,0.439,1.6,5.1,0.318,4.3,8.5,0.512,2.8,3.3,0.866,1.4,7.7,9.1,2.9,0.7,0.8,2.3,2.4,16.3,27.0,San Antonio Spurs

He is a six-time NBA All-Star and five-time All-NBA Team selection, as well as a four-time member of the NBA All-Defensive Team. George played high school basketball for Knight High School before playing two seasons of college basketball at Fresno State. He was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 10th overall pick of the 2010 NBA draft, and earned NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. He was named the NBA Most Improved Player in 2013, when he also earned his first All-Star selection. George suffered a broken leg in 2014 while competing for a roster spot on the United States national team for the FIBA Basketball World Cup. He missed most of the 2014–15 season, but recovered to become an All-Star again in 2016, when he also won an Olympic gold medal. He was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2017, and played two seasons for the Thunder before he was traded to the Clippers in 2019. George was born in Los Angeles County in Palmdale, California, and is the son of Paul George and Paulette George.He grew up with two older sisters: Teiosha, who played basketball at Pepperdine, and Portala, who played volleyball at CSU-San Bernardino.George idolized Lakers star Kobe Bryant,and he grew up rooting for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers.George spent most of his free time playing basketball at the park or one-on-one against his older sister Teiosha.He did not play organized basketball until his freshman year at Knight High School.He played for the varsity basketball team his last three years of high school under head coach Tom Hegre. George played for Pump and Run of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) with future UCLA Bruins Jrue Holiday and Malcolm Lee.George attended Knight High School in Palmdale, California. As a sophomore, he began the season on the JV team, but was moved up to the varsity after the season started.During his junior year, he was the only non-senior on the varsity team starting lineup.Recruiters began noticing George during the summer of 2007, while he competed in AAU tournaments.Sensing George's potential, his coach handed him a leading role his senior season. That year, George led Knight to the Golden League championship, and was named the Golden League Most Valuable Player, the Antelope Valley Press Player of the Year, and a member of the Daily News 2007–08 All-Area Boys' basketball team. He ended his senior year averaging 23.2 points and 11.2 rebounds. Despite his accomplishments, George was not considered a major prospect by colleges. Rivals.com labeled him as a three-star recruit and ranked him 20th among a class of California prospects that was highlighted by Jrue Holiday and DeMar DeRozan. George verbally committed to Santa Clara, the first school that offered him a scholarship, but he later de-committed from them because his high school coach thought he should keep his options open.After a positive experience attending Teiosha's Midnight Madness event at Pepperdine University, George committed to Pepperdine on August 9, 2007. Midway through his senior season, he de-committed from Pepperdine after coach Vance Walberg resigned from the program. He ultimately chose Fresno State over offers from schools like Georgetown and Penn State because of greater opportunities for playing time.George played two years at California State University, Fresno, more commonly known as Fresno State. In his first game with the Bulldogs, he scored 14 points in a winning effort against Sacramento State. The following game, George recorded 25 points and 10 rebounds in a losing effort against Saint Mary's. Despite the loss, he made an impression with his one-handed slam dunk over Mickey McConnell that earned him SportsCenter's number 1 ""Play of the Day"" for November 18, 2008.On February 9, 2009, he scored a then career-high 29 points to lead the Bulldogs to an 88-82 victory over Boise State.In the 2009 WAC Tournament, the Bulldogs were matched up against Hawaii and advanced to the quarterfinal against the top-seeded Utah State Aggies.During the game, he forced a career-high 5 steals and finished with a team-high 16 points; however, despite his effort the Bulldogs lost, 85–68.

He led the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in minutes played (1,176) and finished second in 3-point shooting (44.7%), steals (59) and steals per game (1.74).His 3-point field goal percentage was the third-best in the Fresno State Bulldogs men's basketball program.He started all 34 games and finished the season averaging 14.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.7 steals per game on 47.0% from the field.

On March 31, 2010, George announced that he would forgo his final two seasons of college eligibility at Fresno State and enter the 2010 NBA draft. He made his first appearance on a 2010 mock draft on Draft Express a month into his sophomore season. By May 2010, mock drafts such as Draft Express, ESPN.com, and The Hoops Report predicted that George would be selected 12th overall by the Memphis Grizzlies. Two days before the draft, Marc J. Spears from Yahoo! Sports wrote an article about an anonymous Eastern Conference scout stating that ""in five years, Paul George will be the best player to come out of this draft"". Hoping to draft Derrick Favors, the Pacers had discussed a draft trade with the Nets that would have sent Danny Granger and the 10th pick to the Nets for Devin Harris, Yi Jianlian and the 3rd overall pick, but the deal fell through. George was invited to sit in the green room during the draft and was selected tenth overall by the Indiana Pacers. He became the highest NBA draft pick in Fresno State history. On July 1, 2010, he signed his rookie contract with the Pacers; a two-year guaranteed deal worth $3.9 million, with team options for a third and fourth year.

He finished the 2011–12 lockout-shortened season with averages of 12.1 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists on 44% shooting, George started all 66 games for the Pacers in the season. After beating the Orlando Magic, who were without Dwight Howard, in five games in the first round, the Pacers lost to the eventual NBA champions, the Miami Heat, 4–2 in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with George making just 19 of 52 field goals. During his first two seasons in the NBA, George played mostly the shooting guard position. However, with Danny Granger missing nearly the entire season due to knee and calf injuries, George began playing the small forward position and became the go-to offensive option for the Pacers in his third season. On November 21, 2012, George made nine three-pointers en route to a career-high 37 points in a victory against the New Orleans Hornets. The nine 3-pointers broke the franchise record for most 3-pointers made in a single game, surpassing Hall of Famer Reggie Miller. George was named the NBA's Player of the Week for the first time in his career in December, winning three straight games against Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Detroit. He recorded his first career triple-double in a victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on February 13, 2013, finishing with 23 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists and 2 steals.

At the conclusion of the regular season, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. In Game 1 of the Pacers' 2013 NBA playoffs first-round series versus the Atlanta Hawks, George recorded his first career playoff triple-double, tallying 23 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists in a 107–90 win. It was the first postseason triple-double by a Pacers player since Mark Jackson had one in the 1998 playoffs. On May 13, 2013, George was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. George led the Pacers with 18 points, 14 rebounds and 7 assists in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Knicks on May 14, 2013 in a 93–82 victory. In Game 1 of the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, George made a three-point field goal at the end of the fourth quarter to tie the game and force an overtime period. During overtime, Dwyane Wade fouled George with 2.2 seconds remaining. Despite George making all 3 free-throws and putting his team up 102–101, the Pacers ultimately lost as LeBron James drove in for a buzzer beater lay-up. To cap off a great 2012–13 campaign, George was named to the All-NBA Third Team. On September 25, 2013, the Indiana Pacers extended George's contract, electing him to be their designated player. The extension, which will start at the end of his rookie contract in 2014, is a ""5/30"" designated player extension (5 years and 30% of the salary cap), subject to passing the ""Derrick Rose"" test. George had to be elected to one further All-NBA team (at any level) or be the MVP during the 2013–14 season to qualify for the 30% extension. If he met either of these criteria, the 30% extension is estimated to be worth around $90 million over the 5-year deal. If he had failed to meet the criteria, he would be contracted at 25% of the salary cap. The Pacers started the 2013–14 season 9–0 for the first time in franchise history. George finished with 31 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists, and 4 steals in a 99–91 victory over the Detroit Pistons. He then posted 23 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists during a 91–84 win over the Toronto Raptors on November 8. The following day he scored 24 points and added 6 rebounds in a 96–91 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. For his efforts, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week. With nine wins to start the season, Indiana became the first NBA team to start the season 9–0 since the Dallas Mavericks in the 2002–03 season. The Pacers undefeated streak ended at 9–0 against the Bulls on November 16. On December 2, 2013, he scored a career high 43 points, along with 3 rebounds and 3 assists, in a 106–102 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. The following day, George was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month, the first time in his career, for the month of November while leading the Pacers to a 15–1 record. The Pacers finished the regular season with an incredible 56–26 record. In the 2014 playoffs, the Pacers eliminated the Atlanta Hawks and the Washington Wizards in the first two rounds. In game 4 against the Wizards, George scored a playoff career-high 39 points. The Pacers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat for the third straight year. For his efforts, George was named to the All-NBA third team, qualifying him for the full 30% extension, and All-Defensive First Team. During the 2014 offseason, George was named to the training camp roster for the US national team that would represent the country at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. He had been considered a virtual lock to make the roster. However, on August 1, George landed awkwardly at the base of a basket stanchion after fouling James Harden during a Las Vegas scrimmage, and suffered a compound fracture of both bones in his lower right leg. After George was carted off the court, head coach Mike Krzyzewski addressed the arena stating the game would not continue out of respect to George and his family. George quickly went into surgery for the fracture, with a pin being inserted in the leg. While no official prognosis was initially given, he was considered likely to miss the entire 2014–15 season. George, who had said he wanted to play at some time during the season, was cleared to put weight on the leg in late September, and was shooting jumpers in practice in late October. He participated in his first full practice of the season on February 26, three days earlier than expected, and was ruled a possibility to play within a week on March 20. On April 5, George made his return to the Pacers line-up for the first time since sustaining his leg injury with Team USA.

On March 19, he had a 45-point game in a 115–111 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The Thunder acquired him in spite of his pending free agent status the following year and George's stated preference to join the Los Angeles Lakers in his native Southern California. In his debut for the Thunder in their season opener on October 19, 2017, George scored a team-high 28 points in a 105–84 win over the New York Knicks. On November 10, 2017, he scored a season-high 42 points in a 120–111 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. He made 13 of 22 shots and had nine rebounds and seven assists. After starting the season with an 8–12 record, the Thunder improved to 20–15 with a 124–107 win over the Toronto Raptors on December 27. George scored 33 points against the Raptors and went 7 of 10 from 3-point range, tying the Thunder record for 3-pointers in a game. On January 20, 2018, he had a 36-point effort in a 148–124 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. On January 27, 2018, George was named as a replacement for the injured DeMarcus Cousins on Team LeBron for the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. On February 1, 2018, he scored a season-high 43 points in a 127–124 loss to the Denver Nuggets. In the Thunder's regular season finale on April 11, 2018, George scored 40 points in a 137–123 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. He went 13 of 20 from the field, including eight of 14 3-pointers. In Game 1 of the Thunder's first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz, George scored 36 points in a 116–108 win. He set an Oklahoma City playoff record with eight 3-pointers, making eight of 11 shots from long range, and 13 of 20 shots overall. In Game 4, George scored a team-high 32 points in a 113–96 loss. In Game 5, George recorded 34 points and eight rebounds, as the Thunder rallied from 25 points down in the second half to fight off elimination and beat the Jazz 107–99. The Thunder went on to lose Game 6 to bow out of the playoffs with a 4–2 defeat; George had a game-high eight assists in Game 6, but scored just five points on 2-of-16 shooting. While he still wanted to return to Southern California, George also ""loved the situation"" with Oklahoma City. He decided weeks before free agency began on July 1, 2018, that he would stay with the Thunder, and never arranged a meeting with the Lakers. On July 6, George re-signed with the Thunder to a reported four-year, $137 million contract. On November 8, he had 20 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and six steals in a 98–80 win over the Houston Rockets, helping the Thunder win seven straight after starting the season 0–4. On November 14, he scored a then season-high 35 points in a 128–103 win over the New York Knicks. On December 5, he scored 25 of his 47 points in the fourth quarter, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 3.1 seconds left that gave the Thunder a 114–112 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. On December 19, he recorded 43 points and 12 rebounds in a 132–113 win over the Sacramento Kings. On December 22, he had 43 points and 14 rebounds in a 107–106 win over the Jazz. On January 29, he scored 31 of his 37 points in the first half of the Thunder's 126–117 win over the Orlando Magic. On February 1, he scored 43 points and had a career-high 10 3-pointers in a 118–102 win over the Miami Heat. On February 5, he scored 39 points in a 132–122 win over the Magic, thus scoring at least 37 points for the fifth straight game. On February 9, he scored 45 points in a 117–112 win over the Rockets. On February 11, he recorded his third career triple-double with 47 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a 120–111 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. On February 22, he scored 45 points and hit the game-winning floater with 0.8 seconds left in the second overtime to lift the Thunder to a 148–147 win over the Jazz. He was named Western Conference Player of the Month for February and subsequently finished the season third in MVP voting. The Thunder were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Trail Blazers in five games, despite George scoring 36 points in Game 5. On July 10, 2019, the Thunder traded George to the Clippers for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, five first-round draft picks, and the rights to swap two other first round picks. After missing the first eleven games of the regular season recovering from shoulder surgery, George made his Clipper debut on November 14, 2019 in New Orleans against the Pelicans, scoring 33 points in a 132-127 loss. In his home debut against the Atlanta Hawks two days later, George once again showed out, putting up 37 points in just 20 minutes in a 150-101 victory. On December 9, George made his return to Indiana and recorded 36 points and nine rebounds in a 110-99 win over his former team in the Indiana Pacers. Four days later, George scored a season high 46 points in a 124-117 over the Minnesota Timberwolves, as he and Kawhi Leonard became the first duo in Clippers history to each score 40 points in a single game with Leonard scoring 42. Though NBA.com lists George's height as 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m), a December 15, 2011 report from The Indianapolis Star said that George was 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m). He entered the league as a shooting guard but was later moved to the small forward position, with the emergence of Pacers shooting guard Lance Stephenson. Stephenson's improvement as a facilitator and distributor in the backcourt allowed George to play off the ball more often during games. Early in his career, he was unable to create shots for himself and lacked a great deal of ball handle, something he worked on with trainer Jerry Powell during the 2012 off-season. With All-Star swingman Danny Granger injured during the 2012–13 season, George took on a larger offensive responsibility, which resulted in the NBA Most Improved Player Award. George has established himself as one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA. In addition to his athleticism, he has developed a reputation as a high-flyer by participating in the 2012 and 2014 Slam Dunk Contest. Following the Pacers' win over the Denver Nuggets on February 10, 2014, Nuggets head coach Brian Shaw, called George ""the best two-way player in the game"". George's rapid improvement led Pablo S. Torre of ESPN to dub him the NBA's most anomalous superstar, while stating: ""Has anyone in the NBA ever become better, faster than Paul George?"" In August 2014, it was announced George had changed his uniform number from 24 to 13, giving him the more marketable moniker of PG-13. He then donated all of his old jerseys to his high school in Palmdale, California.",26280,1474,2019-20,34.0,34.0,1001.0,8.7,20.5,0.426,4.0,10.1,0.394,4.7,10.4,0.458,5.1,5.7,0.899,0.5,6.9,7.4,4.8,1.6,0.6,3.7,3.0,26.6,13.0,Los Angeles Clippers

At the end of his first season, he was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.During the 2010 off-season, the Bulls signed power forward Carlos Boozer, who was expected to start at the beginning of the season rather than Gibson. But Boozer broke his hand before the pre-season, and Gibson started the first 15 games of the season. After Boozer's return, Gibson moved into a bench role for most of the season. He was selected as a starter for the Sophomore squad in the 2011 NBA Rising Stars challenge at the All-Star weekend, which the Rookie team won 148-140.

He is the founder of two French immersion private schools, the Toronto French School and The Giles School. Born in Windsor, Ontario, Giles has a Master of Education and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto as well as a Bachelor of Laws from Osgoode Hall in Toronto. In 1954 he married Anna Por with whom he had three children. As founder for 25 years, headmaster of the Toronto French School, Giles introduced bilingual immersion education in Canada at the Toronto French School, which he founded and served for 25 years as headmaster. He also introduced and implemented the first early intervention programmes in Canadian schools. The success of his education model was instrumental in launching French immersion programmes throughout the North American public school system. Giles established the prestigious pre-university competitions, the Canadian Chemistry and Physics Olympiads, and started the first GCE Ordinary (""O"") and Advanced (""A"") examination centre in Canada. He assisted in the creation of the International Baccalaureate and established the first examination centre of the International Baccalaureate in Canada. He has participated actively in worldwide education communities including representing Canada at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th International Curriculum Conferences. Giles received membership in the Order of Canada in 1973 for his initiative in creating and directing the first private school in Toronto offering instruction in the French language. He also received the Queen's Silver Jubilee medal and the Commemorative medal from the Government of Canada. Giles is a Queen's Counsel and worked as a lawyer for many years. He has served as president of a chemical company, an economist in Canada and the Middle East, and director of various public and private corporations. His publications include Schools and Students: Legal Aspects of Administration, the play Mazaryk, as well as poetry and numerous articles in journals. In 1962, the Toronto French School—one of Canada’s most prominent private schools—was created in the basement of the Giles household. Committed to providing their own children with the advantage of a bilingual education, Giles and Anna hired a French language teacher and started an extended home learning programme for six students. Rental facilities became necessary as the school grew and by 1966 six campuses were set up across the Toronto area, including one in Mississauga. Following the addition of the Mildenhall Branch in 1971 and the former Sifton estate in 1981, Giles set out to merge the geographically sprawling Toronto French School premises. In 1984, all of the Toronto locations were consolidated in one campus at Bayview and Lawrence Avenue East and, in 1995, a permanent home was purchased for the Mississauga campus. In 1989 Giles opened The Giles School (then known as The Markham School for Human Development) with just a handful of students in an Anglican church in Toronto. The school moved to another location after one year and then again in 1991. In 1994, with increased enrollment, it opened a second campus to house senior students. In September 2008, the school merged its locations and moved to a permanent home near York Mills and Leslie in Toronto. The Giles School was founded on Giles’ philosophy of education, which is based on six pillars: early academic intervention, bilingualism, third languages, small classes, highest international standards and love. At The Giles School, children are not pre-screened on the basis of standardized tests. In an attempt to counter the exclusive process of private school student selection, Giles instituted a first-come, first-served admissions policy based on the conviction that his unique educational programme would improve the overall academic achievement of any child, regardless of his or her initial or apparent aptitude. The founding of the Toronto French School coincided with what later proved to be education-altering research in neuroscience, cognitive psychology and early childhood development. At the same time that Giles began introducing very young children to a second language with improved academic results across all subjects, the work of Nobel Prize laureates Dr. David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel demonstrated that if the visual cortex behind the eye is deprived of stimulation during initial development, it will never be able to process visual information, even if the eye itself is not defective. Giles’ intuition was vindicated by the discovery that appropriate and targeted sensory stimulation is fundamental during formative brain development, or neural pathways will die and that the window of opportunity for cultivating optimal sensory processing is alarmingly brief. The discovery of this narrowly defined opportunity for bolstering neural pathway expansion has come to be known as the critical period in early brain development. It determines children’s capacity for language acquisition and higher cognitive functioning. During the 1980s and 1990s, interdisciplinary researchers, such as Canadian neurologist Dr. Fraser Mustard, illuminated the connection between optimal early development and durable social health. Giles’ longstanding educational philosophy was further borne out by the realization that early intervention (especially the first 3 years) has a lifelong effect on the brain’s wiring and sculpting, setting the stage for future competence and coping skills.

He played college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats. Gilgeous-Alexander was selected in the first round of the 2018 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets with the 11th overall pick and was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers that same night. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in his lone season with the Clippers before being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder along with Danilo Gallinari and multiple first round picks in a blockbuster deal for Paul George. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was born on July 12, 1998 in Hamilton, Ontario.His mother, Charmaine Gilgeous, is a former track star who competed for Antigua and Barbuda at the 1992 Summer Olympics.His father, Vaughn Alexander, coached him as a youth.He began high school in Hamilton, Ontario at St. Thomas More Catholic Secondary School before switching to Sir Allan MacNab Secondary School, then transferred to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy (located in Chattanooga, Tennessee) for his junior and senior years to improve his basketball skills, graduating in 2017.His cousin is fellow NBA player Nickeil Alexander-Walker.Growing up in Hamilton, he did not make the St. Thomas More junior team in grade 9 and subsequently played on the school's midget squad. He ended up winning team MVP and the midget boys' city championship.He then attended Sir Allan MacNab Secondary School before heading to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2015.""I just thought I needed to play better competition ...,"" he said. As a senior, Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 18.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.0 assists. In early 2016, he participated in the Basketball Without Borders Camp. A four-star recruit (by ESPN), Gilgeous-Alexander originally committed to Florida, but re-opened his recruitment in October 2016. His final five schools were Kentucky, Kansas, Syracuse, Texas and UNLV. The following month, he announced his decision to play college basketball at Kentucky. At the 2017 Nike Hoop Summit, he poured in eleven points in 21:24 minutes of action, representing the World Select Team. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander started the 2017-18 season as a reserve, sitting behind freshman point guard Quade Green, but still averaged over 30 minutes per game. After a tough loss to UCLA, Alexander erupted against Louisville in December, scoring 24 points, grabbing 5 rebounds, dishing out 4 assists, and securing 3 steals. When he first stepped on the University of Kentucky's campus, Gilgeous-Alexander had long hair. However, he cut his hair early in the season and some say this started his progression from sixth man to starting point guard. He continued to lead the team for the following two games against Georgia and LSU, scoring 21 points against Georgia and 18 against LSU. He was a consistent contributor to a ""struggling"" UK team that had a four game losing streak during the season. He became a starter along with four other freshmen: Hamidou Diallo, Nick Richards, Kevin Knox, and P. J. Washington. Despite their losses, his PPG shot up to 12.9 along with 3.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists. Gilgeous-Alexander had a great SEC tournament and continued that momentum into the NCAA Tournament. After playing great basketball in the first two rounds against Davidson and Buffalo, the magic ran out and Kentucky lost to Kansas State in the Sweet 16. Gilgeous-Alexander's final college basketball moment was a missed three-point attempt at the buzzer. On April 9, 2018, he declared for the 2018 NBA Draft. On June 21, 2018, Gilgeous-Alexander was selected with the eleventh overall pick by the Charlotte Hornets in the 2018 NBA draft, before being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers the same day, in exchange for Miles Bridges, the pick after him, and two future second round picks.

On April 21, 2019, he scored a new career-high of 25 points in a 105–113 loss to the Golden State Warriors in game 4 of the 2019 playoffs. On July 10, 2019, the Clippers traded Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, five first-round draft picks, and the rights to swap two other first round picks to the Oklahoma City Thunder for NBA All-Star Paul George.

Gobert declared for the 2013 NBA draft and set NBA Draft Combine records for wingspan (7 feet 8½ inches) and standing reach (9 feet 7 inches) in the 2013 combine.These dimensions earned him the nickname ""The Stifle Tower.""The record for wingspan was broken a year later by Walter Tavares. On June 27, 2013, Gobert was selected with the 27th overall pick by the Denver Nuggets. He was later traded on draft night to the Utah Jazz.On July 6, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Jazz and joined them for the 2013 NBA Summer League. In just his 12th game for the Jazz on November 24, Gobert scored a season-high 10 points against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

In high school, he was named ""Mr. Basketball"" of Indiana during his senior year while playing at North Central High School. He is known, in part, as the subject of a recruiting competition between the University of Illinois and Indiana University in the spring and summer of 2006; because of Gordon's talent and high level of play that year, his recruitment was the subject of media coverage. Gordon played one season of college basketball at Indianaand was considered one of the top collegiate players in the nation that year.He finished his freshman season leading the Big Ten in scoring and tied for 19th in the nation at 21.5 points per game.Gordon entered the 2008 NBA draft and was selected seventh overall by the Los Angeles Clippers. Gordon was born in Indianapolis.At age four, he began playing sports at the Jewish Community Center across the street from his home, starting with soccer and then quickly moving on to basketball. At age seven he began playing competitive basketball at the Municipal Gardens. It was at the JCC that Gordon announced his departure from college to enter his name into the NBA Draft.Gordon attended Fox Hill Elementary School, down the street from his childhood home. He then attended Northview Middle School and North Central High School, where he played varsity basketball all four years. North Central's 2007 game against Loyola Academy of Wilmette, Illinois, attended by Michael Jordan, was aired on ESPN. He scored a record high of 43 points that night. He later went on to score 50 points twice during the season. He led North Central to the Indiana 4A title game his senior year. They fell to E'Twaun Moore, Angel Garcia and East Chicago Central. Gordon averaged 29 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists while shooting 57.0% from the field, 77.9% from the free-throw line, and 46.2% from three-point range. He was named Indiana's ""Mr. Basketball"" for 2007 as well as a McDonald's All-American. Gordon was a teammate of Greg Oden in Indiana AAU ball. Rivals.com ranked him the nation's #2 high school prospect in the class of 2007, behind Michael Beasley.During the summer, Gordon attended many AAU tournaments, Adidas Superstar camps, and Big Time in Las Vegas. He played on teams that included future NBA players Mike Conley, Jr., Josh McRoberts, Daequan Cook, Derrick Rose, and Oden. In 2005 as a sophomore in high school, Gordon made an early unofficial verbal commitment to Bruce Weber, who had somewhat recently replaced Bill Self as the University of Illinois's head coach when Self left to accept the head coaching position at Kansas. On November 30, 2005,Gordon made a verbal commitment to play basketball for Weber at Illinois, despite overtures from Duke, Arizona and Notre Dame.Gordon and his family cited their comfort with Weber, the relative distance to the Illinois campus from their Indianapolis home, and the success of former Illini guards Deron Williams and Luther Head in the NBA as reasons for their decision. On February 15, 2006, Sports Illustrated reported that Mike Davis, then the head coach at Indiana University, intended to resign after the 2005–06 season, due in part to a lack of support after the team failed to make the NCAA Tournament in 2004 and 2005. Indiana subsequently hired Kelvin Sampson as the new men's basketball coach in March 2006. Some reporters speculated that Gordon was uninterested in playing at Indiana under Mike Davis because of Davis's lack of success. Shortly after Sampson was named head coach, he hired Jeff Meyer, Eric Gordon Sr.'s college basketball coach and a longtime family friend, as an assistant. During the subsequent offseason, Gordon was recruited by Sampson's staff after Gordon told Sampson he was again interested in Indiana. It was rumored in July 2006 that Gordon was considering opting out of his unofficial verbal commitment to Illinois because of concerns about the quality of Weber's Illinois recruiting class, but Gordon said that although he was a childhood fan of the Hoosiers and was considering Indiana, he was still committed to Illinois. During that same month, Gordon played with fellow top-5 recruit Derrick Rose in an attempt to convince Rose to join him at Illinois, but Rose declined the offer. Rumors of an impending IU commitment continued into the start of the 2006–07 academic year, fueled in part by Gordon's rise to the top of some services' rankings of high school basketball players and the reemergent Indiana Hoosier basketball program. On September 2, 2006, Gordon and Rose made an unofficial visit to Indiana to scrimmage with Hoosier players, fueling further speculation that Gordon would switch his commitment. Six weeks later, on October 13, 2006, Eric Sr. announced that his son had officially decided to do so. Gordon signed a National Letter of Intent with Indiana on November 8, 2006. Gordon's announcement gave Indiana a very strong 2007 recruiting class, ranked by some analysts as the third-best incoming class in the country. Sampson and Weber both received criticism from fellow coaches for failing to communicate with one another about Gordon's recruitment. Although the NCAA does not regulate verbal commitments or the recruitment of orally committed players, some observers have claimed that Sampson acted unethically in recruiting a committed player without first contacting Weber. The timing of the switch was particularly damaging for Illinois, which had planned for Gordon to be part of its class, and was left without a shooting guard at a time when other guards had made verbal commitments. The Illini received a letter of intent from top 100 shooting guard Quinton Watkins of Compton, California, the following December, but, due to NCAA Academic Clearinghouse issues, he did not play for the Illini, eventually deciding to enroll at San Diego State. Gordon was warmly welcomed by Indiana fans, but received sharp criticism from Illinois fans for publicly maintaining to the press his commitment to playing at Illinois until just a few weeks before he signed with Indiana. Eric Sr. stated in October 2006 that his son had received death threats as a result of his decision, but his son later stated that Illinois fans had only said they did not want the younger Gordon to be successful. On February 7, 2008, when Gordon and Indiana played Illinois in Champaign, he was the target of loud booing and taunting throughout the game. Illinois fans were reportedly particularly enraged that the Gordon family, and its entourage, wore ""Got Gordon?"" T-shirts. At one point during the game, Eric Sr. stood up, turned around facing away from the court, and ""flipped off"" the Illinois fans, which caused fans to focus their ire on Gordon Sr. rather than just his son. Some witnesses reported that his parents were hit with ice, empty plastic water bottles, and orange and blue beads near the game's end. Illinois's athletic director, Ron Guenther, apologized for the incident, calling fan behavior ""disappointing and intolerable."" Gordon attended Indiana University Bloomington (IU). There he played shooting guard with the Hoosiers for one year and planned to study sports management. During his year at IU, Gordon attained many honors. He was the Big Ten Freshman of the Year and made the third team All-American. He is IU's all-time leading freshman scorer. He set a record at IU and in the Big Ten with 669 points. He was a candidate for the Wooden Award and Naismith Award, and was named second-team All-American for CBSSports.com. He wore number 23, as he did in high school. Gordon finished his freshman season averaging 20.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game, making 33.7% of his three-point shots and leading the Big Ten in scoring. He was highly effective for Indiana in its first 18 games as the Hoosiers started the season with 17 wins and only one loss, but entered into a noticeable shooting slump at the end of the year, making only 18.6% of his three-point field goal attempts (13 of 70) after Indiana's February 7 win against Illinois and shooting only 3 of 15 from the field and 0 of 6 from the three-point line in the team's loss to Arkansas in the first round of the 2008 NCAA Tournament. Gordon played the second half of the season with an injured wrist. On March 10, 2008, Gordon was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year and to the First Team of the Big Ten Conference by the coaches and media, along with his teammate D. J. White. He was also a third-team All-American. Gordon announced on April 4, 2008 at 4:00pm at the Jewish Community Center that he would enter the 2008 NBA draft. ESPN analyst Chad Ford ranked Gordon as one of the top ten players in this draft class. He was drafted with the seventh pick in the 2008 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers. Gordon scored 23 points in his first NBA Summer League game in the Las Vegas summer league on the campus of UNLV. Gordon played in two summer league games where he averaged 19 points and 6.5 rebounds. Gordon injured his hamstring July 12 against the Charlotte Bobcats. It was confirmed on July 13, 2008 by the Clippers that Gordon would miss the rest of summer league due to a strained left hamstring. However, at the start of the 2008 NBA pre-season, Gordon made his offensive prowess known in only his second exhibition game, scoring 33 points in 31 minutes to help the Clippers defeat the Sacramento Kings 116–112. On January 23, he set a Clippers franchise record for most points scored by a rookie with 41 points (a record since broken by Blake Griffin). With Gordon's exceptional performance, he was named the NBA Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January. He averaged 16.1 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.0 steals in 34.3 minutes per game and was the third leading scorer among all rookies. For his efforts, he was unanimously selected to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team and finished fifth in Rookie of the Year voting. Gordon participated in the 2010 NBA All-Star Weekend. During the 2010 NBA All-Star Weekend, Gordon and DeMar DeRozan went head-to-head in the inaugural Sprite All-Star Slam Dunk-In, which took place at halftime of the Rookie Challenge. The fans went on to choose DeRozan as their vote to advance to the main event, the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest. Gordon was also selected to the sophomore team for the 2010 T-Mobile NBA Rookie Challenge and Youth Jam event. Gordon finished second on his team with 16.9 points, averaged 2.6 rebounds, 3.0 assists in a team-high 36.0 minutes. He appeared in 62 games, and started in 60 games. He led his team in scoring 16 times, steals 17 times and minutes 16 times. Gordon scored 30+ points one time and had 20+ points 19 times. He was one of 27 players named to 2010–12 USA Men's National Team Program. After winning the gold medal in the 2010 FIBA World Championship, Gordon was geared towards a breakout season. Gordon was on a scoring tear earlier in the season but was slowed down in his game against the Golden State Warriors, with a hard foul committed by Andris Biedriņš, which forced Gordon (who was averaging 24.1 points per game before the injury) to be sidelined for 18 games. It was later revealed that Gordon had a sprained wrist with a bone chip fracture. Returning from an 18-game absence, Gordon had a solid performance with a win against the Houston Rockets with 24 points. Gordon re-aggravated his sprained wrist the second game back against the Denver Nuggets, this time a hard foul committed by Timofey Mozgov, which gave Gordon a 6-game absence. Gordon's breakout season was hampered by injuries and he had to wear a wristband for the remainder of the season. Gordon finished the season as the Clippers' second leading scorer, with 22.3 points per game. He also averaged 2.9 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game. Gordon scored 30+ points 8 times and had a streak of 20 or more points for 12 consecutive games. On December 14, 2011, the Clippers traded Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a 2012 first-round pick (previously acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves) to the New Orleans Hornets in exchange for future teammate Chris Paul and two future second-round picks. In his first ever game as a Hornet, playing against the Phoenix Suns, Gordon recorded 20 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists. He also hit the game winning shot with 4.2 seconds remaining, and New Orleans defeated the Suns in the season opener 85-84. It was revealed that Gordon had a pre-existing knee injury that he aggravated during the opening game of the season against the Phoenix Suns after bumping knees with Grant Hill. Initially Gordon was diagnosed with having a bone bruise, but after further examinations by doctors, it was determined that Gordon had cartilage damage in his right knee.

During the offseason, Gordon admitted that he faced lingering problems with his knee. Microfracture surgery was reportedly proposed as a solution, but in early November, Gordon received a second opinion from a doctor in Chicago, who prescribed continued rehab or his knee and estimated that Gordon would miss 4–6 weeks. On November 7, 2012, Gordon was sent to Los Angeles to get more personalized rehabilitation work to help in his knee recovery and to strengthen his quad muscles. On December 29, 2012, Gordon made his highly anticipated season debut against the Charlotte Bobcats. Gordon, coming off the bench, scored 24 points, 7 assists and 2 steals in less than 25 minutes, giving the New Orleans Hornets a 98-95 win over the Bobcats.

On January 5, 2013, Gordon returned to the starting lineup. Gordon hit the game-winner from the top of the circle with 4.7 seconds left after drawing a foul on Mavericks guard Darren Collison, who bit on Gordon's pump fake as the New Orleans Hornets edged the Dallas Mavericks 99-96 in overtime.

It was later ruled he had knee tendinitis. On April 10, 2014, it was ruled that Gordon will have arthroscopic surgery performed on his left knee, which brought his season to a close.

Gordon finished the 2014–15 season averaging 13.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 3.8 assists in 61 games.

On February 1, 2020, Green tied the career high of 16 assists in the Warriors' 131–112 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Green represented the United States national team at the 2011 Summer Universiade men's basketball tournament in Shenzhen, China. Team USA finished in fifth place in the tournament as Green averaged 8.6 points and 6.0 rebounds with a 46.3% shooting percentage.In June 2016, Green was named in the United States national squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics. He helped Team USA win the gold medal in Rio, and in eight games, he averaged 1.9 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game. Though he is considered undersized for a power forward at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m), Green is a versatile defender, capable of guarding all five positions as both an interior and perimeter defender. Green studies opponents' habits, and leverages his preparation along with his muscular frame and lower-body strength, and is capable of generating rebounds, steals and blocks. He has been named to multiple NBA All-Defensive Teams, and was named the 2016–17 NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Offensively, he can handle the ball on fast breaks and deliver passes to his teammates for scores. He is a capable three-point shooter who provides spacing for the offense by stretching the opposing defense. Green is also adept at scoring around the basket. His outstanding interior defense combined with his offensive repertoire form a unique two-way skill set. Under the coaching of Steve Kerr (and Luke Walton under a temporary basis), Green became crucial to the Warriors' Death Lineup as the team's center. His performance in this position enabled the Warriors to create a number of match-up problems for opposing defenses during the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons. When played as a center, Green's length and strength allow him to credibly defend and contest opposing centers in the post, though he does give up some rebounding ability against taller opponents. On the offensive side, however, he can outrun, out-pass and outmaneuver most other centers in the league, leading to fast-break opportunities and disrupting defensive sets. This versatility and efficiency at the position has resulted in many analysts discussing Green as embodying the future direction of the center position in the NBA, with some even calling him the league's best center. During the 2015–16 season, Green dramatically increased his play-making role on the team, doubling his assists average to a team-leading 7.4 per game—good for seventh in the league and by far the most assists by any power forward that year. Green's ball handling, court vision and unselfishness in a point forward role have been repeatedly cited as a reason why the Warriors improved from 2014–15 to 2015–16. In 2015–16, Green played approximately 20 percent of his minutes in that role, with the Warriors outscoring their appointments by 26.6 points per 48 minutes. Though he took a lesser role on offense for the 2016–17 season, thanks to the addition of former MVP Kevin Durant, he took a step forward on defense, finally winning the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award that he coveted after two straight seasons as runner-up to Kawhi Leonard. He is widely viewed as the emotional and motivational ""heart and soul"" of the Warriors and is noted for his vocal leadership on the court and in the locker room. As the Warriors pushed to the close of a record-setting 2015–16 season, Green was vocal about his desire to break the Chicago Bulls' all-time wins record, and sought the input of his teammates to make sure the team successfully pushed toward the goal together. Green and Curry's on-court chemistry has been cited as a key to the Warriors' improvement in 2015–16, as Green's outspoken, fiery desire has meshed with Curry's quieter, implacable confidence to give the team ""dual—and at times dueling—alpha dogs"" that are ultimately mutually supporting. Green is said to have played a significant role in the recruitment of Kevin Durant to join the Warriors. Because of his highly physical play, including multiple high-profile incidents of physical play in the playoffs, some have criticized him as being a 'dirty' player. Green is frequently among the league leaders in technical fouls. Green is the son of Mary Babers and Wallace Davis.His stepfather is Raymond Green, and he has two brothers, Torrian Harris and Braylon Green, and three sisters, LaToya Babers, Jordan Davis and Gabby Davis. Harris played basketball for Nebraska-Omaha from 2009 to 2011. Green has one child, a son, Draymond Jr., born with his then-girlfriend Jelissa Hardy. Green is now engaged to actress Hazel Renee, with whom he has two children. During his time at Michigan State University, Green practiced with the Michigan State Spartans football team and was in for two plays during the 2011 Green-White spring football game and played tight end. In the summer of 2012, Green moved into an apartment in Emeryville, California. Green considered it too expensive to live in San Francisco as most of his Warriors teammates did and explained his choice of a modest apartment: ""I've been pretty broke my entire life. I'm not going to live that same life, but I'm going to keep those same principles."" Green identifies himself as a Christian. On September 14, 2015, Green donated $3.1 million to Michigan State University, which is the largest pledge from an athlete in the school's history, to help build a new athletics facility and fund an endowment program for scholarships. On July 10, 2016, Green was arrested for assault in East Lansing, Michigan. The night prior, he had a confrontation with Michigan State defensive back Jermaine Edmondson. The arresting report cites Green went to Rick's bar and had bumped into Edmondson. After a verbal exchange, two associates of Green allegedly choked Edmondson and his girlfriend. The next night, both Green and Edmondson attended Conrad's Grill in East Lansing where Edmondson confronted Green about the incident the night before. Green allegedly poked Edmondson in the chest and either slapped or punched him in the face. The arresting officers stated that Green had a blood alcohol level of .10 and admitted to slapping Edmondson and asked to apologize to the victim. After posting a $200 bail, Green was released four hours after the arrest.",26295,1585,2019-20,42.0,42.0,1212.0,3.6,9.4,0.387,1.1,3.8,0.279,2.6,5.5,0.462,1.9,2.5,0.759,0.7,7.2,7.9,7.8,1.7,1.0,2.8,3.1,10.2,10.0,Golden State Warriors

He played college basketball for the Oklahoma Sooners, when he was named the Consensus National Player of the Year as a sophomore. Griffin was selected first overall by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2009 NBA draft, and has since been a six-time NBA All-Star and a five-time All-NBA selection. Griffin won four high school state titles at Oklahoma Christian School under his father, head coach Tommy Griffin. Griffin played two seasons of college basketball for the Sooners before entering the 2009 NBA draft, when he was selected by the Clippers. During the final pre-season game of 2009, he broke his left kneecap, had surgery, and missed the entire 2009–10 season. Griffin made his NBA debut as a rookie the following season, in which he was selected as an All-Star, won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year. In 2011, Sports Illustrated called him one of the NBA's 15 Greatest Rookies of All Time.Griffin was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Tommy Griffin, who is of Afro-Haitian descent, and Gail Griffin, who is white.His father was a basketball center and track standout at Northwestern Oklahoma State University.Griffin and his older brother, Taylor Griffin, were home-schooled by their mother from first grade until Taylor was in the tenth grade and Blake was in eighth.

The day before the 2009–10 season started, it was confirmed that Griffin had a stress fracture in his left knee, delaying his NBA debut for seven weeks. After resting the stress fracture for several weeks, tests revealed that his knee was not recovering properly. In January 2010, Griffin had surgery on his broken left kneecap, causing him to miss the remainder of the 2009–10 season. Since he missed the entire 2009–10 season, Griffin was still considered a rookie during the 2010–11 season. In his NBA debut, against the Portland Trail Blazers, Griffin registered 20 points and 14 rebounds. In a home game against the Golden State Warriors, he set a franchise record for most consecutive double-doubles, with 23.

He played in all 82 regular season games and became the first rookie to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds since Elton Brand did it in the 1999–2000 season. He led all rookies in points, rebounds, and double-doubles, earning him the Rookie of the Year award, and was the first unanimous winner for the award since David Robinson in 1990. He was also the only unanimous selection to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.

The deal would keep him under contract until the end of the 2017–18 season. He was also selected to compete for Team USA in the 2012 London Summer Olympics, but was removed after he injured his knee during a practice.

After a disappointing first round exit in the playoffs, the Los Angeles Clippers sought new leadership and hired head coach Doc Rivers. In his first season with Rivers at the helm, Griffin averaged a career-high 24.1 points per game.

The Clippers would eventually beat the Warriors in seven games in the midst of the Donald Sterling controversy. They would then lose to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the conference semifinals. Griffin was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the third straight year, while also finishing the season third in the MVP voting. After controversial remarks by Clippers owner Donald Sterling, NBA commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league for life and forced him to sell the Clippers.

The dunks are great, but it's his multiple-layered impact that has paved his early road to stardom."" Griffin has a son and a daughter with his former girlfriend Brynn Cameron, who is the sister of former NFL tight end Jordan Cameron. Griffin made his acting debut in 2018 in the Whitney Cummings comedy The Female Brain; of his performance, critic Christy Lemire wrote, ""Griffin especially impresses with his deadpan delivery and timing.

The charges were dismissed in March 2015 for lack of evidence. Griffin started a fundraiser called ""Dunking for Dollars"", in which he donates $100 to fight childhood obesity for every dunk he makes during the season. The Kia sedan that Griffin jumped over to win the Slam Dunk Contest was donated for a charity auction on AutoTrader.com with proceeds benefiting Stand Up to Cancer. Stand Up to Cancer also has a fund-raising site called ""Team Blake"" in honor of Griffin's close friend Wilson Holloway, who died after a three-year fight with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Griffin is a Christian. He spoke of his faith in relation to his rookie season injuries, saying, ""I was just excited about the opportunity to play in the NBA. I was ready to go but everything came crashing down, so to speak, but these things happen. It was frustrating, but at the same time, I know everything happens for a reason. I don't know what that reason is, only God knows. I just have to wait and let His plan unveil.""",26301,1619,2019-20,18.0,18.0,512.0,6.2,17.6,0.352,1.9,7.8,0.243,4.3,9.8,0.439,5.3,6.9,0.776,1.2,4.7,5.9,4.1,0.5,0.5,2.8,1.9,19.6,9.0,Detroit Pistons

The 27th victory of the season gave the team its most wins in 20 years and matched head coach John Beilein's career high.

His Summer League season ended with the injury although the injury only had a short-term impact. In the Knicks' first preseason game, which came on October 9 against the Boston Celtics in Providence, Rhode Island, Hardaway scored 16 points, 10 of which came in the fourth quarter, including the game winning shot with just over 8 seconds left.

Hardaway began the season getting sparse minutes behind starting shooting guard Iman Shumpert and Smith. However, on November 7, the Knicks shuffled the lineup, moving Hardaway into the starting lineup against the Brooklyn Nets. The move came two nights after Hardaway scored a team-high 20 points off the bench against the Detroit Pistons. As the Knicks continued to lose games, Hardaway was moved out of the starting lineup for Quincy Acy on November 12 as head coach Derek Fisher experimented with his lineup. He replaced Anthony in the starting lineup on December 10 and had a team-high 23 points against the San Antonio Spurs.

Then after playing two minutes against the Phoenix Suns, Hardaway injured his wrist on March 15. He then missed the next 9 games before returning to the lineup on April 3 against the Washington Wizards. He again posted 25 points in the season finale on April 15 against Detroit. On June 25, 2015, Hardaway was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for the draft rights to Jerian Grant. Despite averaging 24 points in the Hawks' final two preseason contests, Hardaway was listed as inactive for the season opener. However, on the same day that they announced he would be inactive for the opener, the Hawks announced that they picked up the team option for the 2016–17 season. He was expected to battle Kyle Korver, Kent Bazemore, and Thabo Sefolosha for playing time as the season progressed. Hardaway also found himself competing with Lamar Patterson and Justin Holiday for time as he adjusted to his new team and their new gameplan. As a result, Hardaway did not debut with the Hawks until November 24 against the Boston Celtics in the team's 16th game. On December 3, 2015, using the flexible assignment rule, the Hawks assigned Hardaway to the Canton Charge, the D-League affiliate of the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was recalled by the Hawks three days later. On December 28, again using the flexible assignment rule, he was assigned this time to the Austin Spurs, the affiliate of the San Antonio Spurs. On January 3, 2016, he was recalled by the Hawks. Two days later, he played in his first game for the Hawks since November 28, scoring three points in 12 minutes off the bench in a 107–101 loss to the New York Knicks. He eventually moved into a backup role with the team, playing in 25 consecutive games by the end of February. Hardaway made his first start for Atlanta on March 17, 2016 against the Denver Nuggets.

In the following game on January 13, Harden scored 38 points but was just 1 for 17 on 3-point attempts in a 116–109 loss to the Orlando Magic. On January 14, he scored 57 points in a 112–94 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. On January 16, he scored 58 points in a 145–142 overtime loss to the Brooklyn Nets. On January 23, he scored a career-high 61 points to go with 15 rebounds in a 114–110 win over the New York Knicks, thus setting the fourth-longest streak for 30-point games in NBA history at 21—at the time, Wilt Chamberlain held the three longer streaks (65, 31 and 25). With 37 points on January 29 against the New Orleans Pelicans, Harden extended his streak of 30-point games to 24 and had his 11th straight game with at least 35 points. With 30 points against the Denver Nuggets on February 1 and 43 points against the Utah Jazz on February 2, Harden set the third-longest streak in NBA history for games with 30-plus points. With 42 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on February 13, Harden scored 30 or more points for the 31st consecutive game, tying Chamberlain for the second-longest streak in league history. On February 21, in the Rockets' first game after the All-Star break, Harden scored 30 points against the Los Angeles Lakers for his 32nd consecutive game with 30-plus points. After missing the Rockets' next game with an illness and a strained neck, his return game on February 25 saw him score 28 points against the Atlanta Hawks, snapping his 32-game streak with at least 30. On February 28, he scored 58 points in a 121–118 win over the Miami Heat. On March 19, he scored 31 points in a win against the Hawks and became the first player in NBA history to score 30 or more points against all 29 other teams in a single season. On March 20, he scored 57 points in a 126–125 overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, marking his seventh 50-point game of the season. Two days later, he matched his career high with 61 points, including 27 in the first quarter, to lead the Rockets to a 111–105 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. For these performances, he received his fourth Western Conference Player of the Week honor of the 2018–19 season. On March 31, Harden had 50 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a 119–108 win over the Sacramento Kings to record his ninth 50-point game of the regular season. It was his fifth career 50-point triple-double, the most of any player in NBA history. He also became the ninth player in NBA history to make 2,000 3-pointers in their career. After a 135–103 victory against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 3, he became the third person in NBA history to record 2,700+ points and 500+ assists in a single season. In a 149–113 blowout win against the Phoenix Suns on April 7, Harden's 30-point, 13-rebound, nine-assist, and two-steal performance matched and broke several records: he tied Kobe Bryant for the most 30-point games in one season for any NBA player in the past 30 years with 56 games; became the second player in NBA History (Michael Jordan, 1989–90) to record 2,700 points, 500 assists, and 500 rebounds in one season; and joined Michael Jordan as the only player to average at least 30 points, seven assists, five rebounds and two steals in one season. He finished the season with the largest scoring margin (8.1 ppg) over the second-leading scorer since Chamberlain in 1962–63. Harden led the Rockets to a Game 2 win against the Utah Jazz with 32 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists—his third career triple-double during the postseason—to give the Rockets a 2–0 series lead in the first round. In Game 3 against the Jazz, he had one of the worst shooting nights of his career when he started the game 0-of-15, a figure breaking the NBA playoff record for most missed consecutive shots without a make in a game since Michael Jordan went 0-of-11 in an 87–80 loss against the Miami Heat in the 1997 Eastern Conference Finals. However, he finished the game with 22 points on 3-of-20 shooting, 10 assists, six steals, and four rebounds to lead the Rockets to a 104–101 win, putting the series at 3–0. The Rockets went on to lose 4–2 to the Warriors in the conference semifinals. At the season's end, he was unanimously selected to his fifth All-NBA First Team, and he was announced a finalist for the MVP award. After a disappointing start to the season shooting 28.6% from the field and 15% from the three-point line in the first three games, Harden scored 59 points on 18–32 shooting from the field, along with nine assists in a 159–158 win against the Washington Wizards in October 30, 2019—two points away from his career-high. With this game, Harden extended a streak of having a 50-point game in 6 straight seasons, the 2nd-longest streak in NBA history behind Wilt Chamberlain (10 straight seasons, 1959–69). On November 11, 2019, he was named the Western Conference’s Player of the Week after the Rockets went 3–0, Harden recording a double-double in each game and averaging 40.7 points, scoring 22 3-pointers on 43.1% shooting; 9.3 assists; 8.0 rebounds; 2.33 steals; and 1.33 blocks. Harden has scored a total of 334 points in 318 minutes of play this season, the highest total through the first nine games of a season since Michael Jordan scored 337 in 1988–89. Harden, at this point in the season, hit 39 3-pointers, marking the fourth-highest total through the first nine games of a season and the most by a player besides Stephen Curry. On November 30, 2019, in a 158–111 blowout win against the Atlanta Hawks, Harden got his fourth career 60-point game—tied for third-most with Michael Jordan—with a season-high 60 points along with 8 assists in 31 minutes. With this game, Harden joins Klay Thompson and Kobe Bryant as the only players to hit 60 points in just three quarters. His 24 shot attempts are the fewest ever in a 60-point game in NBA history. Harden is currently the only active player who has scored 60 points more than once. On December 11, 2019, Harden got his fourth 50-point game of the season with 55 points on an efficient 20-of-34 field goal shooting and 10-of-18 from three in a 116–110 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers. He became the fourth player in NBA history with multiple games of 10 or more 3-pointers, joining Stephen Curry (15), Klay Thompson (5), and J.R. Smith (3). He continued his scoring rampage in the following 130–107 win against the Orlando Magic on December 13, 2019, where he got his second 50-point game in a row—the third time in his career where he has scored back-to-back 50-point games—with 54 points on 19-of-31 field goal shooting and 10-of-15 from three, in addition to seven assists, and five rebounds. In this game, Harden became the second player in NBA history to score 10+ 3PM in consecutive games, joining Stephen Curry, who did this in February 2016, and he also passed Paul Pierce for 8th in the all-time career 3PM leaderboard. He also became the first player in NBA history to have 50+ points and 10+ 3PM in back-to-back games. Before those last two performances, only three times had a player attempted seven or less free throws while scoring 54 or more points in a game; Harden did it twice that week. On December 21, 2019, Harden passed Elgin Baylor for most 40-point games in NBA history with 40 points a 139–125 win against the Phoenix Suns. He became the Western Conference player of the month for December for his historical and efficient scoring tear during the month. He finished the decade as the NBA’s leading scorer with 19,578 points going back to January 1, 2010, despite beginning his career as a sixth man with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He was selected to his eighth consecutive All-Star Game as a backcourt starter alongside Luka Dončić. Standing at 6 feet 5 inches tall (1.96 m) in shoes and weighing 220 pounds (100 kg), Harden plays mostly at the shooting guard position. With season averages of over 25 points per game since the 2012–13 season, Harden is considered one of the most versatile and dangerous scorers in the NBA. ESPN named him the 5th best shooter in the NBA throughout the entire 2010s decade. He possesses a wide array of offensive moves; two of the most prominent among them being his Euro step and his step-back jumper. Since his trade to the Houston Rockets in the 2012–13 NBA season, he has scored the most points in the NBA. He is the all-time NBA leader in unassisted three-point makes. He has also gained notoriety for his ability to exploit league rules in order to more efficiently draw fouls and get to the free throw line, from which he is a career 85.7% shooter. He is the all-time leader in 3-point shooting fouls drawn, and he has led the NBA in free throw attempts and makes every year since the 2014–15 season. He is also the all-time leader in completed four-point plays, passing Sixth Man of the Year Jamal Crawford with his 54. Though primarily a scorer, he is also known for his playmaking ability, orchestrating the Rockets' offense with his elevated assist numbers. During the early portion of the 2016–17 season, Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni played Harden at point guard, which resulted in him averaging over 10 assists per game for the first time in his career. He is also the all-time franchise leader in assists for the Rockets. While he has garnered acclaim for his prowess on the offensive end, Harden has built a reputation as a poor defender. Criticism of his defense intensified in early 2014, when a video titled ""James Harden: Defensive Juggernaut"" featuring eleven minutes worth of clips of Harden conceding field goals, was circulated on the Internet. During the 2014 offseason, he committed to an improvement on defense, which manifested as early as August of that year as a member of the United States men's national basketball team. His improved defense carried over to the following season, and has been cited as a major reason for the Rockets' regular season success. Another negative aspect of his game that is sometimes brought up by pundits are his turnovers. Harden set the NBA record for turnovers during the 2015–16 season and broke it again the following season. Harden was a member of the United States national team that won a gold medal at the 2012 Olympics, and was also a member of the team that won the FIBA Basketball World Cup in 2014. Harden was a candidate for the 2016 Olympics, but he withdrew from the team. Harden is the youngest of three children. Before his birth, after that of his older sister, their mother suffered a string of miscarriages. Harden is a Christian. He has talked about his faith, saying, ""I just want to thank God for everything he has done in my life."" Harden started growing his trademark beard in 2009 after being too lazy to shave. His beard has appeared in songs and T-shirts, and it earned him an endorsement and a unique candy with Trolli's where a depiction of his face and beard was shown on each gummy. On August 3, 2015, the sports apparel company Adidas submitted an endorsement deal to Harden worth $200 million over the next 13 years. On July 18, 2019, Harden became a part owner in Houston's professional soccer teams; the Houston Dynamo of MLS and the Houston Dash of NWSL. Harden explained his decision by saying ""Houston is my home now, and I saw this as a way to invest in my city and expand my business interests at the same time"" as well as ""This is my city and I'm here to stay."" On October 4, 2019, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey issued a tweet that supported the 2019 Hong Kong protests. Morey's tweet resulted in the Chinese Basketball Association’s suspension of its relationship with the Houston Rockets. Harden later apologized to China, saying: ""We apologize. We love China.""",26307,1715,2019-20,52.0,52.0,1921.0,9.8,22.5,0.436,4.4,12.5,0.356,5.4,10.0,0.537,10.2,11.8,0.871,1.0,5.3,6.3,7.2,1.6,1.0,4.3,3.3,34.3,11.0,Houston Rockets

On August 10, 2012, he was traded from Philadelphia to the Orlando Magic as part of a four-team, 12-player deal.Harkless impressed in his first NBA season, averaging 8.2 points per game and providing good defense.He scored in double figures 29 times and had 20-plus points four times, including a career-high 28 points on April 1 against the Houston Rockets.He recorded one double-double during the season, registering 19 points and a career-high 14 rebounds on February 2 against the Milwaukee Bucks.He had at least one steal in 50 games and two-or-more steals 22 times, including a career-high six steals on March 15 against the Oklahoma City Thunder.Harkless began the 2013–14 season starting alongside Arron Afflalo and Jameer Nelson. When Victor Oladipo was inserted into the starting lineup, coach Jacque Vaughn opted to play combinations of Nelson, Oladipo, Afflalo and Tobias Harris on the wing. As a result of the backlogged situation, Harkless' minutes decreased from his rookie season.He scored in double figures 30 times and had 20+ points three times, including a season-high 22 points on January 6 against the Los Angeles Clippers and February 25 against the Washington Wizards.He had one double-double during the season, recording 12 points and a season-high 10 rebounds on March 8 against the San Antonio Spurs.He recorded at least one steal 54 times and had two-or-more steals 31 times, including a season-high five steals on March 5 against Houston.During the 2013–14 season, Harkless averaged 7.4 points, 3.3 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 24.4 minutes per game. He improved his 3-point shooting, increasing his accuracy from 27.4 percent as a rookie to 38.3 percent in his second year.Harkless bottomed out in 2014–15, receiving minimal playing time and creating questions about his future.He played in only a career-low 45 games during his third season in Orlando despite good health. Harkless sat behind fellow forwards Tobias Harris and Aaron Gordon during the 2014–15 season and averaged just 15 minutes per game. On March 18 against the Dallas Mavericks, Harkless started for Harris and played 36 minutes. He scored 18 points on 8-of-15 shooting, including two 3-pointers, grabbed six rebounds and recorded four steals. In the next game however against the Portland Trail Blazers, Harkless missed five of six shots and finished with just two points in 28 minutes. He made little impact the rest of the season.On July 14, 2015, Harkless was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for a 2020 second round draft pick. He worked his way up from the end of the bench to starter by the end of the 2015–16 season. Portland began to play small late in the season by inserting Harkless into the lineup. After averaging 6.4 points and 3.6 rebounds a game during the regular season, Harkless rode his inspired play into the playoffs, boosting his numbers to 11 points and 5.1 rebounds respectively. On February 10, 2016, he set season highs with 19 points and 13 rebounds in a 116–103 win over the Houston Rockets. On April 5, 2016, he recorded a season-high 20 points and a career-high 16 rebounds in a 115–107 win over the Sacramento Kings. A restricted free agent over the summer, Harkless was expected to be re-signed, but when the Trail Blazers added Evan Turner and reacquired Allen Crabbe, it appeared Harkless would be heading elsewhere. However, on July 27, 2016, Harkless signed a four-year, $40 million contract to remain with the team. After experimenting with various lineups early in the preseason, coach Terry Stotts quickly settled back on Harkless as the starting small forward, a position he would hold on to for the majority of the season. After a scoreless, single-rebound performance on opening night against the Utah Jazz, Harkless put up 23 points and eight rebounds in the second game of the season against the Los Angeles Clippers on October 27. Harkless scored a season high-tying 23 points on November 30 against the Indiana Pacers. Harkless improved his 3-point shooting during the 2016–17 season, increasing his average from 28 percent to 35 percent. It was reported that Harkless was due a $500,000 bonus if he shot 35 percent or better from the 3-point line. Sitting at .351 with four games to go, Harkless declined to attempt a 3-pointer for the rest of the season, even sitting out one of the four games for unrelated reasons. Harkless started the 2017–18 season as the starting small forward, before losing the spot after averaging 4.5 points and 3.8 rebounds over his first 18 games. On December 23, he scored a season-high 22 points against the Los Angeles Lakers. He found himself in and out of the rotation until an injury to Evan Turner in February saw Harkless return to the starting line-up. He appeared in 59 games in 2017–18 after surgery in late March to his left knee saw him sit out the last nine games of the regular season and two of Portland's four playoff games. Over the first half of the 2018–19 season, Harkless missed 14 games because of his troublesome left knee. On April 9, 2019, he scored 26 points and hit a corner 3-pointer at the buzzer to lift the Trail Blazers to a 104–101 win over the Lakers. On July 6, 2019, Harkless was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with a protected first round pick from the Miami Heat as part of a four-team trade, in which Miami acquired Jimmy Butler and the Portland Trail Blazers acquired Hassan Whiteside. On February 6, 2020, Harkless was traded to the New York Knicks in exchange for Marcus Morris in a three-team deal along with the Washington Wizards, with Los Angeles sending Jerome Robinson to Washington in exchange for Isaiah Thomas. In January 2014, Harkless declared his interest in playing for Puerto Rico at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup following a series of meetings with coach Paco Olmos. However, he later withdrew his name from contention in July 2014 in favor of preparing for the 2014–15 NBA season.A year later, he debuted for the Puerto Rican national team. Harkless is the son of Rosa Harkless. He has one sister, Shakima Harkless, and a brother, Tyler Rodgers.His maternal grandfather is from Puerto Rico.

He also represents the Croatian national team internationally. He primarily plays at the small forward position. He was selected with the fifth overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. Hezonja was promoted to the club level in his native Croatia when he was 12 years old, and at the age of 13, he stayed for two seasons with Dubrovnik. In 2010, Hezonja signed a contract with Croatian club, Zagreb. In 2011, he won the Nike International Junior Tournament with Zagreb. He was also named to the All-Tournament team, alongside teammate, Dario Šarić. He was forced to sit out the 2011–12 season because of mononucleosis. In July 2012, Hezonja signed a three-year contract with Spanish club Barcelona, at the age of 17.He also had an option to extend his contract for an additional four years with the club. His former club, Zagreb, also got 150,000 euros in the name of a buyout, as he was still under contract. For the 2012–13 season, he was loaned to the reserve team of the club: Barcelona B of the LEB Oro, the Spanish second tier level division. In 2012, Hezonja was nominated for the FIBA Europe Young Player of the Year Award,but Jonas Valančiūnas eventually won the award. Hezonja played in the EuroLeague for the first time, in the 2012–13 season. He appeared in only 2 games, averaging 2.5 points and 2 rebounds per game. In 2013, Hezonja was invited to be a part of the world team at the Nike Hoop Summit, but couldn't attend because of injury. During the EuroLeague's 2013–14 season, Hezonja became a more constant part of Barcelona's first team rotation, although playing very limited minutes. Starting with the 2014–15 season, Hezonja's role in the team increased, from playing only during the garbage time in the previous season, to around 15 minutes per game, on a constant basis. On 1 February 2015, Hezonja hit 8-of-8 from the three-point line in a 2014–15 Spanish League season game, in a 101–53 Barcelona win, against La Bruixa d'Or Manresa, becoming the Spanish League MVP for the week 19 of the season.Barcelona finished their participation in the 2014–15 EuroLeague season, after a quarterfinal series loss to Olympiacos. Over 22 EuroLeague games played, Hezonja averaged 7.7 points, 2 rebounds, and 1 assist per game. On 23 April 2015, Hezonja declared himself eligible for the 2015 NBA draft, as an international ""early-entrant"", just days after Barcelona's elimination in the EuroLeague.He had been identified as a potential lottery pick early in his career, and surprised many by opting not to declare for the draft in 2014, his first year of eligibility.Some Spanish and Croatian media saw this move as the player's response to poor communication throughout the final few months with Barcelona's head coach Xavi Pascual; Pascal denied any problems in communication.Barcelona eventually finished the season losing in the final series of the 2015 Spanish League playoffs, after a 3–0 series loss to Real Madrid.On 25 June 2015, Hezonja was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Orlando Magic in the 2015 NBA draft. On 10 July 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Magic.

On 11 April 2016, he set career highs with seven assists and five steals while scoring 19 points in a 107–98 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. The Orlando Magic finished the season with 35–47 record, missing the Playoffs. Hezonja finished the season making 79 appearances with the averages of 6.1 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.4 assists on 43.3 field goal percentage. At the end of the season, the Orlando Magic front office made a head coach change, replacing Scott Skiles with Frank Vogel. Under new head coach Frank Vogel, Hezonja saw minutes reduction, mainly due to his mediocre defense. On 28 October 2016, Hezonja scored 13 points in a 108–82 loss to the Detroit Pistons. He tied that season high on 4 April 2017, registering another 13-point effort in a 122–102 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In the Magic's season finale on 12 April 2017, Hezonja grabbed a career-high 11 rebounds in a 113–109 win over Detroit. Although his defense improved towards the end of the season, his shooting ability vanished. In general, his sophomore season was underwhelming, and with reduced minutes his game averages dropped to just 4.9 points and 2.2 rebounds per game on 35.5 field goal percentage. The Orlando Magic finished the season with 29–53 record, missing the Playoffs for the fifth season in a row. On 31 October 2017, Hezonja's fourth-year option was not picked up by the Orlando Magic.

While playing for Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) he received many honors, including Summit League Player of the Year and was an honorable mention All-American his junior season. He was selected 26th overall by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2008 NBA draft. Born and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, Hill looked up to players like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird while dreaming of one day playing in the NBA;when asked about his goal of becoming a first-round pick in the 2008 NBA draft, Hill commented: ""It's my childhood dream"".An only child,Hill attended Broad Ripple High Schoolwhere he excelled as one of the top high school players in the state and was one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" from Indianapolis (with Greg Oden, Mike Conley, Jr., Josh McRoberts, Rodney Carney, Eric Gordon, and Courtney Lee).Carney remembers playing against Hill: ""This little kid comes in hitting all kinds of 3s, and I was like, 'Who is this little dude?...I knew he was going to be something when I saw this little skinny kid handling the ball and shooting like that.""Hill played against every member of the Magnificent Seven except Gordon, who was recovering from a broken wrist during their meetup.He faced off against Oden and Conley during his junior year in high school, and remembers playing pickup games against 10-year-old Gordon when he was 13.In his senior year, Hill averaged a state-leading 36.2 points per game, the fifth-highest single-season average in Indiana High School Athletic Association history.Despite scholarship offers from several big conference schools, including Temple and Indiana, he chose to commit to IUPUI, wishing to stay with his ailing great-grandfather, Gilbert Edison.A few months after he agreed to attend IUPUI, his great-grandfather died, never getting the opportunity to see Hill play basketball at the college level. Following his great-grandfather's advice to always be a man of his word, Hill decided to pass on other offers and stay at IUPUI.In his sophomore year, he led the IUPUI Jaguars to a tie for the best record in the conference. Following an injury that forced him to become a redshirt in his third year at IUPUI, Hill returned the next season and led the Jaguars to a school-record 26 wins and the Summit League Tournament finals before losing to eventual champion Oral Roberts University and thus failing to secure a spot in the NCAA tournament. Not counting Hill's injury-shortened 2006–07 season, the Jaguars were 61–30 during his three seasons at IUPUI. Despite having one year of eligibility left, Hill, wishing to ""test the waters"", declared himself eligible for the 2008 NBA draft. He left IUPUI as the fifth all-time leading scorer with 1,619 points, and became the second IUPUI player to declare earlyafter Carlos Knox in 1997 (he later withdrew his name). Although he had regularly attracted NBA scouts to his college games, he was not projected in most mock drafts largely due to remaining unannounced. In the following months, Hill worked out with several NBA teams. After an impressive run at the Orlando pre-draft rookie camp, Hill attracted attention and became a projected second-round selection. On draft night, the San Antonio Spurs surprised many by selecting Hill with their 26th pick in the first round; many expected the Spurs to select Mario Chalmers of Kansas. Hill became the second first-round draft choice in The Summit League's history and the first player ever drafted from IUPUI. On September 23, 2008, the Spurs signed Hill to a standard rookie contract that guaranteed the first two years and included a team option on the next two years. On July 14, 2008, in his first summer league game as a Spur, Hill scored 17 points and grabbed 8 rebounds while holding fellow draft pick O. J. Mayo to 5-of-17 shooting en route to a victory for the Spurs. Throughout the summer league Hill struggled with his shooting, making only 2 of 25 shots (8.0%), and one of six three-pointers (16.7%). Hill played in all but one of the four summer league games for the Spurs; he finished averaging 8.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 3.0 assists in 31.7 minutes per game. At the Utah Revue, Hill led his team by averaging 12.9 points over four games; however he continued to struggle offensively with his shooting, only making 21.4% of his three-point field goals. In the first of the four games, Hill led all scorers with 21 points and helped the Spurs defeat the Utah Jazz, 82–57. He followed up with a quiet offensive performance, 6 points, in a win against the NBDL Ambassadors, before scoring 18 points in a loss versus the Gerald Green-led Mavericks. In the final game of the Revue, Hill once again struggled with his shooting (1–7) but managed to make key plays with the game on the line. Hill made two clutch free throws with 6.9 seconds left and then forced a turnover on the defensive end to beat the previously undefeated Atlanta Hawks. In 2008, Hill joined the San Antonio Spurs and made his NBA debut on November 4 against the Dallas Mavericks in the third game of the season. He had sat out the previous two games due to a sprained left thumb. In 15 minutes of play, Hill finished with 11 points, 1 steal, and 1 assist. Hill initially served as the main reserve at point guard, but after Tony Parker suffered an injury early in the season he was promoted to starter. After the return of Parker and Manu Ginóbili, Hill received fewer minutes. He finished his rookie season averaging 5.7 points per game, 2.1 rebounds per game, and 1.8 assists per game. Hill made his playoff debut in game 2 of the Spurs first-round series against the Mavs, but only played 5 minutes. Hill spent most of his off-season working on his point-guard skills, supervised by player development coach Chad Forcier, and his jump shots with Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland. Following the advice of former Spur Bruce Bowen, he focused on developing his corner three-point shot. By the time training camp arrived, Hill had converted 8,000 threes. His hard work during the off-season paid large dividends as soon as the 2009-10 season commenced. Hill saw his minutes increase from 16.5 to 29 a game. He also started in 43 games, most of them while Tony Parker was battling injuries. Hill more than doubled his scoring average, improved his field goal percentage by 7.5 percentage points, and his 3-pt shooting by 7.9 percentage points. On April 1, Hill notched career highs of 30 points, 5 steals, and 7 assists in a home game win against the Houston Rockets. Hill ended the regular season tied at second place with Kevin Durant and Marc Gasol for the Most Improved Player of the Year award. All three garnered a total of 101 points. The Spurs' first-round playoff series with the Mavs was a breakout series for Hill. He was ineffective in Game 1, scoring 0 points in 17 minutes after coming back from an ankle injury. He shook off his tentativeness in the next few games, scoring 7 and 17 points in Games 2 and 3. Then Hill led the Spurs to a Game 4 victory on a night when the Spurs' Big Three of Duncan, Parker, and Ginobili shot a combined 9-of-34 from the field. Hill scored a career playoff high 29 points, shooting 11-16 from the field and 5-6 from downtown. Hill averaged 22.3 points in the series, helping the Spurs to win the series in six games. On March 28, 2011, Hill matched his career high of 30 points in a 119–114 loss to the Houston Rockets. Hill was traded to the Indiana Pacers during the 2011 NBA Draft on June 23, 2011, a trade that sent rights to the 15th overall pick Kawhi Leonard, the 42nd pick, Dāvis Bertāns, and 2005 draftee Erazem Lorbek to the Spurs in exchange for Hill. Hill started the shortened season as a backup for Darren Collison. On January 31, 2012, Hill left the game against the New Jersey Nets after suffering an ankle injury. The Pacers announced it was a small chip fracture. He missed 12 games with the injury and returned on February 22, against the Charlotte Bobcats. On April 9, 2012, Pacers coach Frank Vogel announced that Hill would start for the injured Collison. Although Collison returned from the injury, Hill remained a starter for the rest of the season. Hill finished the season averaging 9.6 points per game with a field goal percentage of .442. During their first-round playoff series against the Orlando Magic, Hill scored double-digits in all five games as the Pacers advanced to the Eastern Conferences Semifinal. Facing the Miami Heat in the Conference Semifinals, Hill scored a playoff high 20 points and 5 assists in game 3. The Heat won the next 3 games, advancing to the Conference Finals and eventually becoming NBA champions. On July 13, 2012, Hill re-signed with the Pacers to a reported five-year, $40 million contract. During the 2012–13 season, Hill made a game-winning floater against the Toronto Raptors and a game-winning layup over the outstretched arms of Dwight Howard against the Los Angeles Lakers. Hill had the best game of his NBA career on February 7, 2014 when he scored a career-high 37 points in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers along with 9 rebounds and 8 assists including a game-tying three-pointer to force the game to overtime. After missing the first 28 games of the season with a left knee injury, Hill returned to action on December 23 against the New Orleans Pelicans. In just over 21 minutes of action off the bench, he recorded 15 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 1 steal in the 96-84 win.

The deal was fully guaranteed for its first two seasons, with only $1 million guaranteed for the 2019–20 season. On February 8, 2018, Hill was acquired by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team trade that also involved the Kings and the Utah Jazz. The Cavaliers won the Eastern Conference championship and were defeated in the 2018 NBA Finals by the Golden State Warriors. On December 7, 2018, Hill was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a five-player, three-team deal that also included the Washington Wizards. Following the 2019 season, Hill signed a 3-year, $29 million contract to remain with the Milwaukee Bucks. On draft day, ESPN reported that Hill had a 6'9"" wingspan. Hill's athleticism, length, and strength are among his greatest assets; going into the NBA he was said to have ""NBA-ready"" defense but to still need improvement offensively. Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich said, ""He does a little bit of everything. The great thing about him is that he's a very good all-around basketball player, he's a tenacious defender, he can score, he can run, he's a good passer, he knows how to play and he's really a team guy"". When asked on multiple occasions which current NBA player he most resembled, Hill picked Monta Ellis, adding that he saw himself as a combo guard and an energy player who enjoys playing defense and getting into the passing lanes. Hill was drafted by the Spurs to back up All-Star Tony Parker at point guard. On January 16, 2016, Hill's girlfriend, Samantha, gave birth to the couple's first child, Zayden Jaxon Hill.

10771,1896,Aaron Holiday,Aaron Shawn Holiday,G,6-0,185.0,September 30 1996,"Ruston, Louisiana",False,/players/h/holidaa01.html,12.0,[12],"Aaron Shawn Holiday (born September 30, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. The guard played in high school in Los Angeles, where he was ranked among the top players nationally. Holiday was a starter as a college freshman in 2015–16 before becoming the Bruins' leading reserve the following year. As a junior, he returned to the starting lineup as the Bruins' point guard, and earned All-American recognition as well as first-team all-conference and all-defensive honors in the Pac-12. Holiday was selected by the Pacers in the first round of the 2018 NBA draft with the 23rd overall pick. He is the younger brother of NBA players Jrue and Justin Holiday. Holiday was born in Ruston, Louisiana, to Shawn and Toya (née DeCree) Holiday.His parents both played college basketball at Arizona State,where Toya was named Pac-10 Player of the Year in 1982.Holiday attended high school at Campbell Hall in Los Angeles, where he was a four-year starter.As a freshman, he led the team in scoring, averaging 24.3 points per game.He averaged 28.9 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.0 assists as a junior before being named both CIF Southern Section IV-A and Los Angeles Daily News Player of the Year honors.Holiday improved as a facilitator as a senior, when his scoring dropped, but his passing enabled other teammates to emerge as scoring threats.Averaging 25 points, 8.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2.5 steals, he led Campbell Hall to its first sectional and California regional final since 2008, and shared Daily News Player of the Year honors with Bennie Boatwright of Valley Christian. Holiday was rated a four-star college recruit as one of the top prep players in the nation, ranked No. 40 by Scout.com, No. 60 by Rivals.com, and No. 88 by ESPN.com. Holiday entered UCLA with a reputation as a tenacious defender capable of applying full-court pressure. After an exhibition game against the Bruins, Cal State Los Angeles coach Dieter Horton admired his ability to disrupt, calling him a ""little Tasmanian devil on defense"". Holiday and fellow recruit Prince Ali brought needed depth to UCLA, who were thin at guard during the previous season. In Holiday, Bruins' third-year coach Steve Alford possessed the most natural point guard he had had at the school. He hoped the freshman could help ease ball-handling duties from incumbent point guard Bryce Alford, the coach's son, who was more effective catching the ball and shooting. In a scrimmage against San Diego State which Bryce Alford mostly missed due to an injury, Holiday's performance against a strong Aztecs defense prompted their coach, Steve Fisher, to call him ""by far the best player on the floor"". UCLA opened the 2015–16 season with Holiday as starter, along with Alford and Isaac Hamilton, in a three-guard lineup. Hamilton could also play point guard, but Holiday and Alford shared most of the responsibilities. In the season opener, Holiday and Tony Parker had six turnovers apiece as UCLA turned the ball over 23 times in an 84–81 overtime loss to Monmouth. On December 3, 2015, Holiday had 10 points, seven assists, and eight rebounds in an 87–77 upset over No. 1 Kentucky, the Bruins' first win over a top-ranked opponent since 2003. On January 9, 2016, he made the go-ahead three-point field goal with just over a minute remaining in an 81–74 win over Arizona State, which helped UCLA avoid falling to 1–3 in the Pac-12 Conference for the first time in almost 20 years. However, the Bruins lost their final five games of the season to finish with a 15–17 record. Holiday started all 32 games during the season, averaging 10.3 points while leading the team in both steals (1.4) and three-point field goal percentage (41.9), which also ranked sixth in the Pac-12. He was second on the team in assists (4.0). His 127 assists were the fifth-highest freshman total in school history, and the most by a UCLA freshman since his brother Jrue had 129 in 2008–09.In 2016–17, Holiday was moved to the bench and became the Bruins' sixth man as star freshman point guard Lonzo Ball joined seniors Alford and Hamilton in the starting lineup. Despite a drop in playing time from his freshman season, Holiday had a better season by comparison. He did not complain about his new role, and thrived while continuing to receive starter-like playing time as the Bruins frequently used a four-guard lineup. On December 3, 2016, he scored 13 points and had four assists to lead No. 11 UCLA to a 97–92 road win over No. 1 Kentucky, ending the Wildcats' 42-game home winning streak. He led the team in scoring in the first half, when he made all four of his shot attempts and scored all of his 13 points as the Bruins built a 49–45 lead. His performance amidst Ball's struggles early in the game was lauded by the Los Angeles Times, ESPN.com, and NBCSports.com for changing the course of the game. UCLA earned a No 3 seed in the 2017 NCAA Tournament. With Ball slowed by a hip injury in their opening game against Kent State, Holiday had 15 points and a career-high 11 assists off the bench to help the Bruins win 97–80. The Bruins ended the season 31–5 after losing in the Sweet 16 to Kentucky. For the season, Holiday averaged 12.3 points and 4.4 assists in over 26 minutes per game, and he received honorable mention for the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team. Although he was not listed in most mock drafts, he declared for the 2017 NBA draft. Later, he withdrew his name from the draft to retain his college eligibility. Holiday assumed the starting point guard role in the 2017–18 season after Ball was drafted with the No. 2 overall pick by the Los Angeles Lakers. UCLA lost four starters from the previous year, leaving Holiday as the team's leading returning scorer. He and five-star freshman recruit Jaylen Hands gave the Bruins two fast guards capable of handling the ball, and they were expected to play alongside each other as well as share point guard duties. Against Wisconsin in the CBE Hall of Fame Classic, Holiday made a layup with 0.8 seconds left in the game to give UCLA a 72–70 win. On December 9, 2017, he had then-career highs of 27 points and seven turnovers as UCLA had 20 turnovers and blew a 15-point, second-half lead in a 78–69 overtime loss to Michigan. On December 23, Holiday had 20 points and eight assists to offset another seven turnovers in an 83–75 upset over No. 7 Kentucky. The performance helped him earn Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career. On December 29 in UCLA's conference opener, Holiday scored 23 of the Bruins' first 32 points, including 15 straight, and finished with a career-high 33 points in a 96–82 win over Washington State. He added 11 rebounds and four assists and did not commit a turnover while playing all 40 minutes. He was the first UCLA player to have at least 33 points and 11 rebounds in a game since Ed O'Bannon in 1995. On February 15, 2018, Holiday scored 17 points and had a season-high 10 assists in a 75–68 win over Oregon State. The next contest in their final home game of the season, the Bruins won 86–78 in overtime against Oregon behind Holiday's 29 points and six assists. UCLA blew a double-digit lead in the second half when the Ducks went on a 13–0 run after Holiday went to the bench in foul trouble. Coach Alford stated that Holiday's value was underscored by the team's plus-minus when he is out of the game, and he called his star guard a candidate for Pac-12 Player of the Year. After leading the Bruins' sweep of the Oregon schools, Holiday was named Pac-12 Player of the Week for the second time. In the regular-season finale, Holiday scored the team's final nine points and finished with a career-high 34 points on 11-of-16 shooting with seven assists in an 87–72 victory over USC, completing a season sweep in their crosstown rivalry and clinching a bye and the No. 4 seed for the Bruins in the upcoming Pac-12 Tournament. He was named Pac-12 Player of the Week for a third time, which led the conference. In UCLA's Pac-12 Tournament opener, Holiday scored 34 points for the second consecutive game and added eight assists and seven rebounds to lead an 88–77 win over Stanford. He played all 40 minutes of the game for the fourth time in five contests. The Bruins qualified for the 2018 NCAA Tournament, but lost 65–58 to St. Bonaventure in the First Four for the Bonnies' first tournament win in 48 years. Holiday scored 20 points and committed a career-high 10 turnovers, but also led a defense that limited Jaylen Adams to eight points on 2-for-16 shooting. Holiday finished the season averaging a Pac-12 leading 20.3 points per game and ranked second with 5.8 assists while playing in a conference-high 37.7 minutes per game. He was the school's first player to average at least 20 points since O'Bannon in 1994–95, and the first to lead the conference in scoring since Reggie Miller in 1985–86. He also became the second Bruin to average at least 19 points and five assists, joining Bill Walton in 1973–74. Holiday was voted third-team All-American by the Sporting News, and was also named first-team All-Pac-12. Regularly assigned to defend the opponent's top guard, he earned Pac-12 All-Defensive Team honors. After the season, Holiday decided to forgo his senior year at UCLA and declare for the NBA draft, where he was projected to be as high as a mid-to-late first-round selection. Holiday was selected by the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the 2018 NBA Draft with the 23rd overall pick. Entering the 2018–19 season, Indiana coach Nate McMillan figured it would be difficult for him to receive consistent playing time behind veteran point guards Darren Collison and Cory Joseph, while Tyreke Evans and Victor Oladipo were capable of handling the ball and running the point as well. On November 17, 2018, Holiday scored 12 points and made three 3-pointers in 15 minutes to lead a 97–89 comeback win over the Atlanta Hawks. He had a team-high nine points in the fourth quarter in a game which the Pacers played mostly without their leading-scorer Oladipo. Holiday had not played in the previous nine games, and had logged just 16 minutes all season. ""We don't win this game if he doesn't come in and play this game the way he did at both ends of the floor,"" McMillan said. With Oladipo out the following game, Holiday scored 19 points and had seven rebounds in 21 minutes in a 121–94 win over the Utah Jazz. Oladipo missed 11 games before returning, during which Holiday averaged 8.0 points on 42.9 percent shooting, 2.9 rebounds, and 1.9 assists in 16.6 minutes. The Pacers went back to their earlier rotation without Holiday, but he returned in the end of January 2019 after Oladipo suffered a season-ending right knee injury. On February 5 against the Los Angeles Lakers, he scored 17 points while shooting 7-of-10, including 3-of-4 from 3-point range, as the Pacers won 136–94 to hand LeBron James the most lopsided loss (42 points) of his career. However, Holiday fell out of the rotation again after Indiana acquired guard Wesley Matthews later in the month. Holiday appeared in 50 games during the regular season, averaging 5.9 points while making 40 percent of his field goals, including 34 percent on 3-pointers. He played sparingly in the playoffs, when the Pacers were swept 4–0 in the first round by the Boston Celtics. During the offseason, Holiday was joined on the Pacers by his older brother Justin, who signed a one-year contract as a free agent. On December 28, 2019, Holiday scored a career-high 25 points in a 120–98 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 28 against New Orleans, he and brothers Justin and Jrue, who plays for the Pelicans, became the first trio of brothers to share an NBA court simultaneously. In late January 2020, Holiday fell out of the rotation after Oladipo recovered from his knee injury and made his season debut. Holiday is the youngest of four children. Like Justin, his other older brother Jrue also became an NBA player. Jrue also attended UCLA, as did sister Lauren, who played on the Bruins women's basketball team. Additionally, Holiday is a brother-in-law of U.S. women's national soccer team player Lauren Holiday.",26339,1896,2019-20,49.0,19.0,1117.0,5.8,14.1,0.415,2.4,5.8,0.413,3.4,8.3,0.416,1.5,1.7,0.87,0.6,2.9,3.5,5.4,1.1,0.4,2.0,2.8,15.6,12.0,Indiana Pacers

House was ranked 15th in the 2012 class by ESPNU 100 and 26th overall by Scout.com. House committed to Houston over Ohio State, Baylor, Texas, Georgetown, and Kansas.House began his collegiate career at Houston, where he averaged 12.4 points per game as a freshman while competing in 33 games with 27 starts. He was named C-USA Freshman of the Year, the first in school history to receive the honor. In the first round of the College Basketball Invitational, House hit the game-winning shot against Texas with 17 seconds left. As a sophomore, he was the Cougars' leading scorer and rebounder with 13.6 points and 5.4 rebounds per game, and led the team to the conference semifinals. After the 2013–14 season, House left the team for personal reasons.For his junior season, House transferred to Texas A&M. After missing the first three games, he received an NCAA waiver allowing him to play for the Aggies in the 2014–15 season. He averaged 16.2 points per game and earned first-team All-SEC honors. House suffered a foot injury near the end of the season and missed the team's final four games. During his senior season, House averaged 15.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game and scored at least 20 points in nine games. For the first three games of the season, House scored a total of 50 points in wins over USC Upstate, Southeastern Louisiana, and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi. The Aggies went to the Battle 4 Atlantis finals, losing to Syracuse 74–67. Along the way, the Aggies beat former rival Texas and upset No. 10 Gonzaga with House scoring 19 in each contest. The Aggies finished the regular season with 13 wins, sharing the SEC championship with Kentucky.

By the 5:14 mark in the second half, House had not scored any pointsand ended with 22 in a double-overtime game where the Aggies overcame a 12-point deficit with 44 seconds remaining in regulation to win 92–88. It was the largest last-minute comeback in NCAA basketball history.After going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, House joined the Washington Wizards for the 2016 NBA Summer League.On September 23, 2016, he signed with the Wizards.House made his NBA debut on November 11, 2016, recording one rebound in 50 seconds of action against the Cleveland Cavaliers.On November 30, 2016, he was diagnosed with a fracture in his right wrist and was subsequently ruled out for at least six weeks.On March 1, 2017, he was waived by the Wizards. House appeared in just one game for the Wizards, as he missed 39 games with the right wrist injury and 10 games on assignment to the NBA Development League with the Delaware 87ers. Around the start of training camp, he signed up with the Houston Rockets. However, he would be one of the players cut from the final roster at the conclusion of preseason on October 15. He would later be assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the newly rebranded NBA G League afterwards. House would play for the squad throughout the month of November and the beginning of December, averaging 17.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 assists per game there. On December 8, 2017, the Phoenix Suns signed House to a two-way contract with the team. Throughout the rest of the season, House would split his playing time there between Phoenix and their NBA G League squad, the Northern Arizona Suns. House would make his debut with the team a day later, scoring two points and recording a single rebound in 11 minutes of play in a close loss against the San Antonio Spurs. On December 16, House would score a season-high 8 points in 15 minutes of playing time in a 108–106 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. House was later assigned to the Northern Arizona Suns affiliate alongside Davon Reed on December 28, mainly for healing purposes. House then returned to action on January 5, 2018, recording what was at the time a new season-high 9 points in a loss against the San Antonio Spurs. On February 23, his two-way contract expired, meaning he couldn't be allowed to play for Phoenix again until after the NBA G League's first season under its rebranded name concluded. Once that happened, he was allowed to return to Phoenix for the rest of the season. On March 30, House recorded a career-high 8 rebounds in a heartbreaking, buzzer-beating loss against the Houston Rockets. On April 1, House would record a new season-high with 16 points scored alongside 6 rebounds and 3 assists in a 117–107 loss against the Golden State Warriors. Two days later, House recorded 14 points, 6 rebounds, and a career-high 5 assists in a 97–94 win against the Sacramento Kings. On April 6, House would put up his first start in the NBA against the New Orleans Pelicans. Two days later, House would record career-highs of 22 points and 8 rebounds in a 117–100 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On June 26, 2018, it was revealed that House would play for the Houston Rockets in the 2018 NBA Summer League, in which he started in all five games. On September 21, 2018, House signed an Exhibit 10 contract with the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors released him on October 12. He then re-joined the Rio Grande Valley Vipers (RGV). In 18 games this season for RGV, he averaged a team-high 20.7 points, 4.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.3 steals, including 2.8 made 3-pointers per game. On November 26, 2018, the Houston Rockets announced that they had called up House from their NBA G League affiliate, Rio Grande Valley Vipers, but several days later, the Houston Rockets announced on December 4 via Twitter that House was waived. Two days later, he was signed to a two-way contract by the Rockets. On January 16, he was sent back to Rio Grande after House turned down Houston's contract offers, both of which revolved around signing a three-year deal. In 25 games, House averaged 24.8 minutes, 9.0 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.0 assists per game, shooting 39.0 percent from three-point range. He started in 12 consecutive games between December 22 and January 14—a stretch where the team went 9-3. On March 12, 2019, Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle reported that the Houston Rockets intended to convert House's two-way contract into a standard NBA contract for the remainder of the season. On March 13, 2019, Daryl Morey announced that the contract conversion was official. On March 15, Chris Paul was rested against the Phoenix Suns, allowing Danuel House Jr. to join the starting lineup in his first game back. In 35 minutes of play, House Jr. tied his season-high number of points in one game with 18 points. He collected three rebounds and one steal, shot 50% from three-point range and 54.55% from the field overall. On June 30, he agreed to a three-year, $11.1 million extension. On November 27, 2019, House scored a career-high 23 points in 34 minutes in a 117–108 win against the Miami Heat.

11043,1944,Dwight Howard,Dwight David Howard,C,6-10,265.0,December 8 1985,"Atlanta, Georgia",False,/players/h/howardw01.html,14.0,"[22, 11, 14, 1, 30]","Dwight David Howard II (born December 8, 1985) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is an eight-time All-Star, eight-time All-NBA Team honoree, five-time All-Defensive Team member, and three-time Defensive Player of the Year. Howard, who plays center, spent his high school career at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy. He chose to forgo college, entered the 2004 NBA draft, and was selected first overall by the Orlando Magic. Howard set numerous franchise and league records during his time with the Magic. In 2009, he led the team to the NBA Finals. In 2012, after eight seasons with Orlando, Howard was traded to the Lakers. Following a one-year stint with the Lakers, he played for the Houston Rockets, the Atlanta Hawks, the Charlotte Hornets, and the Washington Wizards. Howard was born in Atlanta, to Dwight Sr. and Sheryl Howard, and into a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College.Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born.A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine.Despite his large frame, Howard was quick and versatile enough to play the guard position.He elected to attend Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy for high school, and in his four years he played mostly as power forward, averaging 16.6 points, 13.4 rebounds and 6.3 blocks per game in 129 appearances.As a senior, Howard led his team to a 31–2 record and the 2004 state title,while averaging 25 points, 18 rebounds, 8.1 blocks and 3.5 assists per game.That same year, Howard was widely recognized as the best American high school basketball player, and he was awarded the Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award, the Morgan Wootten High School Player of the Year Award, Gatorade National Player of the Year and the McDonald's National High School Player of the Year honor.He was also co-MVP (with J. R. Smith) of the McDonald's All-American Game that year.On January 31, 2012, Howard was honored as one of the 35 greatest McDonald's All-Americans.Following his high school successes, Howard chose to forego college and declared for the 2004 NBA draft—a decision partly inspired by his idol Kevin Garnett who had done the same in 1995—where the Orlando Magic selected him first overall over UConn junior Emeka Okafor.He took the number 12 for his jersey, in part because it was the reverse of Garnett's 21 when he played for Minnesota.Howard joined a depleted Magic squad that had finished with only 21 victories the previous season; further, the club had just lost perennial NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady.Howard, however, made an immediate impact. He finished his rookie season with an average of 12 points and 10 rebounds, setting several NBA records in the process. He became the youngest player in NBA history to average a double double in the regular season.He also became the youngest player in NBA history to average at least 10 rebounds in a season and youngest NBA player ever to record at least 20 rebounds in a game.Howard's importance to the Magic was highlighted when he became the first player in NBA history directly out of high school to start all 82 games during his rookie season.For his efforts, he was selected to play in the 2005 NBA Rookie Challenge, and was unanimously selected to the All-Rookie Team.He also finished third in the Rookie of the Year voting. Howard reported to camp for his second NBA season having added 20 pounds of muscle during the off-season.Orlando coach Brian Hill—responsible for grooming former Magic superstar Shaquille O'Neal—decided that Howard should be converted into a full-fledged center.Hill identified two areas where Howard needed to improve: his post-up game and his defense. He exerted extra pressure on Howard, saying that the Magic would need him to emerge as a force in the middle before the team had a chance at the playoffs.On November 15, 2005, in a home game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Howard recorded 21 points and 20 rebounds, becoming the youngest player ever to score 20 or more points and gather 20 or more rebounds in the same game. He was selected to play on the Sophomore Team in the 2006 Rookie Challenge during the All-Star break.Overall, he averaged 15.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, ranking second in the NBA in rebounds per game, offensive rebounds, and double-doubles and sixth in field goal percentage.Despite Howard's improvement, the Magic finished the season with a 36–46 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the second consecutive season since Howard's arrival. In the 2006–07 season (and for the third consecutive season), Howard played in all 82 regular-season games. On February 1, 2007, he received his first NBA All-Star selection as a reserve on the Eastern Conference squad for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game.On February 9, he made a game-winning alley-oop off an inbound pass at the buzzer against the San Antonio Spurs. Howard set a new career high with 35 points against the Philadelphia 76ers on April 14. Under his leadership, the Magic qualified for the 2007 NBA Playoffs as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. There, the Magic were swept by the Detroit Pistons in the first round. For the season, Howard averaged 17.6 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, finishing first in the NBA in total rebounds, second in field goal percentage, and ninth in blocks. He was named to the All-NBA Third Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign. Howard continued posting impressive numbers in the 2007–08 season and helped the Magic have their best season to date. Howard was named as a starter for the Eastern Conference All-Star team. On February 16, 2008, he won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest by receiving 78% of the fan's votes via text messaging or online voting; in that contest, he performed a series of innovative dunks said to have rejuvenated the contest, including donning a Superman cape for one of the dunks. Howard led the Magic to their first division title in 12 years and to the third seed for the 2008 NBA Playoffs. In their first round match-up against the Toronto Raptors, Howard's dominance (three 20-point/20-rebound games) helped Orlando to prevail in five games. Howard's series total of 91 rebounds was also greater than the total rebounds collected by the entire Toronto frontcourt. In the second round against the Pistons, the Magic lost in five games. For the season, Howard was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time, and was also named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. The 2008–09 season began well for Howard. Ten games into the season, the center was leading the league in blocks per game (4.2). In December, Howard injured his left knee, which caused him to miss a game due to injury for the first time in his NBA career; previously, he had played in 351 consecutive games. He garnered a record 3.1 million votes to earn the starting berth on the Eastern Conference team for the 2009 NBA All-Star Game. Howard led Orlando to its second straight Southeast Division title and to the third seed for the 2009 NBA Playoffs; the team finished the season with a 59–23 record. In the first round of the playoffs against the 76ers, Howard recorded 24 points and 24 rebounds in Game 5 to give Orlando a 3–2 lead before the Magic closed out the series in six games. In the second round against the Boston Celtics, after the Magic blew a lead in Game 5 to fall behind 3–2 in the series, Howard publicly stated that he should have been given the ball more and questioned coach Stan Van Gundy's tactics. The Magic went on to defeat Boston to win the series and move on to the Eastern Conference Finals. There they, defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–2. Howard had a playoff career-high 40 points to go with his 14 rebounds in the deciding Game 6, leading Orlando to the NBA Finals for the first time in 14 years. In the NBA Finals, the Los Angeles Lakers took the first two home games, before a home win by the Magic brought the deficit to 2–1. In Game 4, despite Howard putting up 21 rebounds and a Finals record of 9 blocks in a game, the Magic lost in overtime. The Lakers went on to clinch the series with a win in Game 5. For the season, Howard became the youngest player ever to win the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.He was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team, and to the All-NBA First Team. In the 2009–10 season, the Magic got off to a strong start, winning 17 of their first 21 games and setting a franchise record. On January 21, 2010, Howard was named as the starting center for the East in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. The Magic completed the regular season with 59 wins and their third consecutive division title. The Magic's playoff run resulted another Eastern Conference Finals appearance, where they lost in six games to the Celtics. Howard won the Defensive Player of the Year Award for the second straight year. He became the first player in NBA history to lead the league in blocks and rebounds in the same season twice—and for two years in a row. In the 2010–11 season, Howard posted career highs in points and field goal percentage. He became the first player in league history to win Defensive Player of the Year honors for three consecutive seasons. Howard led the league in double-doubles and also averaged 14.1 rebounds, 2.3 blocks and a career-high 1.3 steals this season. He led the Magic to 52 wins, as they finished as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. They went on to lose to the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of 2011 NBA Playoffs. He had a playoff career-high 46 points and 19 rebounds in Orlando's 103–93 loss to Atlanta in Game 1. Howard led the NBA in technical fouls with 18 in the regular season, and received one-game suspensions after his 16th and 18th technicals. Due to a lockout, the 2011–12 regular season was shortened to 66 games. Not long after the lockout ended, Howard, who was eligible to become a free agent at the end of the season, demanded a trade to the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers or Dallas Mavericks. Howard stated that although his preference was to remain in Orlando, he did not feel the Magic organization was doing enough to build a championship contender. He would later meet with Magic officials and agree to back off his trade demands, but stated that he also felt the team needed to make changes to the roster if they wanted to contend for a championship. On January 12, 2012, Howard attempted an NBA regular season record 39 free throws against the Golden State Warriors. Howard entered the game making 42 percent of his free throws for the season and just below 60 percent for his career. The Warriors hacked Howard intentionally throughout the game, and he broke Wilt Chamberlain's regular-season record of 34 set in 1962. Howard made 21 of the 39 attempts, finishing with 45 points and 23 rebounds in the Magic's 117–109 victory. On January 24, 2012, Howard became the Magic's all-time scoring leader. On March 15, 2012, on the day of the trading deadline for the 2011–12 NBA season, Howard waived his right to opt out of his contract at the end of the season and committed to stay with the Magic through the 2012–13 season. He had previously asked to be traded to the New Jersey Nets. Had he not signed the amendment, the Magic were prepared to trade him to avoid losing him as a free agent. On April 5, Van Gundy said that he had been informed by management that Howard wanted him fired. During the interview, the center walked up and hugged his coach, unaware that Van Gundy had confirmed a report that Howard denied. Van Gundy was let go after the season. On April 19, 2012, Howard's agent said that Howard would undergo surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back and would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. During the offseason, Howard again requested a trade to the Nets, who had relocated to Brooklyn. He intended to become a free agent at the end of the 2012–13 season if he was not traded to Brooklyn. On August 10, 2012, Howard was traded from Orlando to the Los Angeles Lakers in a deal that also involved the Philadelphia 76ers and the Denver Nuggets. Howard took six months off from basketball after his April back surgery, and only had the combined four weeks of training camp and preseason to prepare for the season. Still working himself into shape, Howard paced himself throughout the season on both offense and defense. On January 4, 2013, Howard injured his right shoulder in the second half of the Lakers' 107–102 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. At the midpoint of the season, the Lakers were a disappointing 17–24. Howard was averaging 17.1 points on 58.2% shooting, 12.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks, but also 3.6 fouls a game with 3.2 turnovers while making only 50.4% of his free throws. Howard was upset that he was not getting the ball enough, and he felt that Kobe Bryant was shooting too much. Moving forward, Howard said he needed to ""bring it"" and dominate in more ways than just scoring. Howard missed games due to his recurring shoulder injury in January and February. In February, Bryant said that Howard ""worries too much"" and ""doesn't want to let anyone down"", urging him to play through the pain when Pau Gasol was sidelined with a torn plantar fascia. Howard returned the next game after commenting that Bryant was ""not a doctor, I'm not a doctor. That's his opinion."" During the All-Star break, Howard adopted a healthier diet to get into better shape to anchor the Lakers' defense and run head coach Mike D'Antoni's preferred pick and rolls. Still, on February 23, Howard said he was ""not even close"" to physically being where he wanted to be. Coach Mike D'Antoni attributed Howard's difficulty running the pick-and-roll—a play the coach had expected would be a staple for the team—with Steve Nash to Howard's lack of conditioning. The Lakers were 8–2 after the All-Star break, passing Utah for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference, and Howard averaged 15.5 points, 14.8 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks. In his first game back in Orlando on March 12, Howard scored a season-high 39 points and had 16 rebounds in a 106–97 Lakers win. Booed throughout the game, he made 25-of-39 free throws, setting franchise records for free throws made and attempted while tying his own NBA record for attempts. Howard made 16-of-20 free throws when he was fouled intentionally by the Magic. With Howard anchoring the Lakers defense and his improved overall play, the Lakers made the playoffs, but were swept in the opening round by San Antonio. Howard was ejected in Game 4 with over nine minutes left in the third quarter. Howard finished the season with his lowest scoring average since his second year in the NBA, but he was the league leader in rebounding and ranked second in field goal percentage. Although he was recovering from his back surgery, he only missed six games all season—all due to his torn labrum. Howard was named to the All-NBA Third Team after having received five consecutive first-team honors. He became a free agent in the summer, and he was offered a maximum contract of five years and $118 million by the Lakers. On July 13, 2013, Howard signed with the Houston Rockets, joining James Harden to form a formidable duo. Howard finished the regular season with averages of 18.3 points and 12.2 rebounds and earned All-NBA Second Team honors. During the 2014 playoffs, Howard averaged 26 points and 13.7 rebounds per game, but the Rockets were eliminated by the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, losing the series 4–2. After playing in the Rockets' first 10 out of 11 games to start the 2014–15 season, Howard missed 11 straight due to a strained right knee before returning to action on December 13 against the Denver Nuggets and recording his 10,000th career rebound. However, on January 31, Howard was ruled out for a further month due to persistent trouble with his right knee. After setbacks forced him out for a further month and a total of 26 games, Howard returned to action on March 25 against the New Orleans Pelicans. He started the game but was held under 17 minutes by coach Kevin McHale and finished with just four points and seven rebounds in a 95–93 win. Howard played only 41 games in the regular season. The Rockets clinched their first division title in over 20 years and made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost 4–1 to the Golden State Warriors. On November 4, 2015, Howard had 23 points and 14 rebounds against the Orlando Magic. He shot 10-of-10 to become the first Rocket to make 10 or more field goals without a miss since Yao Ming went 12-of-12 in 2009. On December 26, he eclipsed 15,000 points for his career in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On January 18, 2016, in an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, Howard had 36 points and tied a career high with 26 rebounds en route to his 10th straight double-double, the league's longest active streak at the time, and his longest since a 14-game run in 2012–13. On June 22, 2016, Howard declined his $23 million player option for the 2016–17 season and became an unrestricted free agent. On July 12, 2016, Howard signed a three-year, $70 million contract with the Atlanta Hawks. With the retirement of Tim Duncan, Howard entered the 2016–17 season as the NBA's active leader in rebounds (12,089) and blocked shots (1,916). In his debut for the Hawks in their season opener on October 27, Howard grabbed 19 rebounds in a 114–99 win over the Washington Wizards. It was the most rebounds for anyone in their Atlanta debut, breaking the mark of 18 that Shareef Abdur-Rahim set on October 30, 2001. On November 2, he scored a season-high 31 points in a 123–116 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. On February 2, he had a season-best game with 24 points and 23 rebounds in a 113–108 win over the Rockets in Houston. On June 20, 2017, the Hawks traded Howard, along with the 31st overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft, to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Marco Belinelli, Miles Plumlee and the 41st overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft. To begin the season, Howard became the first Charlotte player since Emeka Okafor in 2007 with four consecutive 15-rebound games. In the fifth game of the season, he had another 15-rebound game. On March 15, he scored 20 of his season-high 33 points in the second half of the Hornets' 129–117 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On March 21, Howard recorded 32 points and a franchise-record 30 rebounds in a 111–105 win over the Nets, becoming just the eighth player in league history with a 30–30 game. He became the first NBA player with a 30-point, 30-rebound game since Kevin Love in November 2010, and the first player with a 30–30 game against the Nets since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in February 1978. Howard finished the season with a franchise-record 53 double-doubles and joined Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to hold single-season records with two teams. Howard also became one of six players to average a double-double in each of his first 13 seasons in the league. On July 6, 2018, Howard was traded to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Timofey Mozgov, the draft rights to Hamidou Diallo, a 2021 second-round draft pick and cash considerations. He was waived by the Nets immediately upon being acquired. On July 12, 2018, Howard signed with the Washington Wizards. He missed all of training camp, every exhibition game and the first seven regular-season games with a sore backside. He appeared in nine games in November before missing the rest of the season after undergoing spinal surgery to relieve pain in his glutes. In March 2019, it was revealed that Howard, in addition to his back injury, was also dealing with a hamstring issue. On April 18, 2019, Howard exercised his $5.6 million player option to play a second season with the Wizards. On July 6, 2019, Howard was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for forward C. J. Miles. On August 24, 2019, Howard was waived by the Grizzlies. On August 26, 2019, Howard signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, reuniting him with his former team. On January 13, 2020, Howard scored a season-high 21 points on a 9–of–11 shooting and got a season-high 15 rebounds. Howard was named on March 5, 2006 to the 2006–2008 USA Basketball Men's Senior National Team program.As the team's regular starting center, he helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour, and subsequently helped the team win the bronze medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship.During the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, Howard was on the team which won its first nine games en route to qualifying for the finals and a spot for the 2008 Olympics. He started in eight of those nine games, averaging 8.9 ppg, 5.3 rpg and led the team in shooting .778 from the field. In the finals, he made all seven of his shots and scored 20 points as the USA defeated Argentina to win the gold medal. On June 23, 2008, Howard was named as one of the members of the 12-man squad representing the United States in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. With Howard starting as center, Team USA won all of its games en route to the gold medal, breaking their drought of gold medals dating back to the 2000 Olympics. Howard averaged 10.9 points and 5.8 rebounds per game in the tournament. Standing at 6 feet 10 inches tall (2.08 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120 kg), Howard plays the center position. Howard led the NBA in rebounding from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2013. Howard's rebounding is in part facilitated by his extraordinary athleticism; his running vertical leap was tested at 39.5 inches in 2011, rare for a player of his size. He demonstrated this skill in the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest, where he completed an alley oop dunk from teammate Jameer Nelson while slapping a sticker onto the backboard at 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) high. The sticker showed an image of his own smiling face with a handwritten ""All things through Christ Phil: 4:13"", a paraphrase of Philippians 4:13. Howard's abilities and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: "" is so developed... He has so much promise and I am glad that I will be out of the league when he is peaking."" Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: "" is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence."" Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: ""It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're going to have to change the rules.""In December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA. Early in his career, many sports pundits rated Howard as one of the top young prospects in the NBA. Howard has a reputation as a negative locker room presence. In a 2013 interview, Howard described his former Orlando Magic teammates as a ""'team full of people no one wanted'"". In a 2013 article entitled ""Is Dwight Howard the NBA's Worst Teammate?"", Bleacher Report asserted that Howard had ""extinguished all bridges with the franchise where he spent his first eight NBA seasons"". Howard did not get along with Kobe Bryant when he played for the Los Angeles Lakers and did not get along with James Harden when he played for the Houston Rockets. When he was traded from the Atlanta Hawks to the Charlotte Hornets, some of his Hawks teammates reportedly cheered. After Charlotte traded Howard to the Washington Wizards, Charlotte player Brendan Haywood asserted that Howard's teammates were ""sick and tired of his act"". In 2018, NBC News reported that ""Howard’s time with the Magic, Lakers and Rockets devolved into interpersonal strife well before he left those teams"". Also in 2018, The Ringer published a piece entitled ""Everybody (Still) Hates Dwight"" in which it described Howard as ""almost certainly the least popular player in the NBA"". Before signing with the Lakers in 2019, Howard reportedly met with the team multiple times, ""promising not to live up to his reputation as a difficult teammate who disrupts locker rooms""; the team warned him that he would be released if he became a disruptive presence. Howard has five children by five women. In 2010, Howard won a defamation judgment against Royce Reed, the mother of his oldest child Braylon. A Florida judge ruled that she violated a court order prohibiting her from mentioning Howard in the media. He had initially sought about half a billion dollars in damages, claiming that she had disparaged him through Twitter and her appearances on the reality television show, Basketball Wives, as the couple's paternity agreement stipulated a $500 fine for each time she mentioned him in public. In October 2014, police in Cobb County, Georgia investigated claims by Reed that Howard abused their son. Howard had admitted to hitting Braylon with a belt; he had been disciplined in the same manner while growing up, and he stated that he did not realize it was wrong to do so. Howard was not charged in connection with the allegations. Howard was also involved in a civil case with Reed over custody of their son. Howard keeps approximately 20 snakes as pets and has appeared twice in Animal Planet's reality TV series Tanked. He owns a farm ""in north Georgia where he relaxes [with] cows, hogs, turkeys and deer,"" and also grows vegetables on his estate. Before he was drafted in 2004, Howard said that he wanted to use his NBA career and Christian faith to ""raise the name of God within the league and throughout the world"". He has stated he believes in reaching out to his community and fans and thus contributes substantially in the field of philanthropy.Together with his parents, Howard established the Dwight D. Howard Foundation Inc. in 2004. In November 2009, the center was named one of the 10 finalists for the Jefferson Awards for Public Service, which awards athletes for their charitable work. Howard appeared as a special guest on an episode of the ABC series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired April 2, 2006, in which Ty Pennington and his team built a new home and ministry offices for Sadie Holmes, who operates a social services ministry in the Orlando area. In 2014, Epix featured Howard as the focal point of a documentary about his life called In the Moment.",26348,1944,2019-20,53.0,2.0,1049.0,5.8,7.9,0.738,0.1,0.2,0.6,5.7,7.7,0.741,2.5,5.4,0.468,4.8,9.4,14.2,1.2,0.8,2.4,2.2,5.9,14.2,14.0,Los Angeles Lakers

His father played in the Republic of the Congo and with the Congolese national team, and his mother played for the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He started playing basketball at a very young age with his first club, Avenir du Rail, using the sport as an escape from his mother's untimely death and his father's imprisonment during the Second Congo War.His father organized for the family to flee the country prior to the war, but ended up as a political prisoner upon their return.Ibaka moved to France at the age of 17 and joined a second division basketball team before moving to Spain, where he taught himself Spanish.In Spain, he soon began playing with a second division basketball club CB L'Hospitalet.

The swingman was an NBA All-Star in 2012 and has been named to the NBA All-Defensive Team twice. He won three NBA championships with the Golden State Warriors and was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2015. He was also a member of the United States national team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and 2012 Summer Olympics, winning the gold medal both times. Iguodala played college basketball with the Arizona Wildcats. After earning first-team all-conference honors in the Pac-10 (known now as the Pac-12) as a sophomore in 2004, he was selected in the 2004 NBA draft with the ninth overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers. Iguodala played for Philadelphia until the summer of 2012 when he joined the Denver Nuggets in a four-team trade. He was acquired by Golden State in 2013. In 2014–15, he became a reserve for the first time in his career, but he captured the Finals MVP after returning to the starting lineup in the middle of the championship series. Iguodala was born in Springfield, Illinois. He is the son of Linda Shanklin. His older brother, Frank, played for Lake Land College in Mattoon, Illinois, and Dayton.His mother is African American, while his father is Nigerian.Growing up, Iguodala rooted for the Chicago Bulls, and he cites Michael Jordan as the player he looked up to.Iguodala attended high school at Lanphier High School in Springfield, Illinois, a school that produced other notable athletes, including baseball Hall of Famer Robin Roberts and basketball guard Kevin Gamble. At Lanphier he did well academically and athletically; he won All-Conference academic honors, was on the National Honor Roll, was a State Journal Student-Athlete of the Week several times,and gained three letters in track for the high jump.As a senior in 2002, Iguodala led Lanphier's basketball team to a runner-up finish at the Illinois High School Association Class AA state tournament. That season, he averaged 23.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. He was named Chicago Sun-Times Player of the Year as well as a second-team Parade All-American and Nike All-American. Iguodala was also a finalist for the Illinois Mr. Basketball award, which was awarded to Dee Brown. His Lanphier jersey is now retired. During the summer of 2000, Iguodala captured the attention of coaches around the nation as he was named the AAU national tournament Most Valuable Player after hitting the game-winning shot at the final buzzer to give his team the 17-and-under national title. In 2002, he played in the Jordan Brand Classic in Washington, D.C. In 22 minutes of play, Iguodala put up six points on 3–6 shooting, five rebounds, two assists, three steals and a block. Iguodala played AAU basketball under Larry Butler and the Illinois Warriors, the team that has featured other professional players such as Dwyane Wade, Quentin Richardson, and Jon Scheyer. Considered a four-star recruit by Scout.com, Iguodala was listed as the No. 6 small forward and the No. 26 player in the nation in 2002.Iguodala initially signed a National Letter of Intent to play at Arkansas. He had narrowed down his list of desired schools to two: Kansas or Arkansas. Iguodala was enticed by Arkansas's 1–3 system, which would have allowed Iguodala to run the point occasionally. Iguodala visited the Arkansas campus and was impressed by their large gymnasium and the number of fans at a practice while he visited with his mother and father.However, after their coach, Nolan Richardson, was fired that year (2002), Iguodala decided to attend Arizona instead. At Arizona he joined future NBA players Channing Frye, Luke Walton, Mustafa Shakur, Salim Stoudamire and Hassan Adams. One of the determining factors for Iguodala was the commitment of Hassan Adams, whom Iguodala had played with in the Jordan Brand Classic in high school. Many colleges regarded Iguodala as a track star turned basketball player but teammate Luke Walton said, ""He is going to be one of the best players to ever come out of Arizona by the time he is done here"". He was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshmen team for 2002–03. In his freshman year he quickly established himself as one of the best all-around players on the team, ranking in the top 5 for his team in just about every major category.As a sophomore in 2003–04, Iguodala was named team MVP after leading his team in rebounds, assists and steals. He also made the All-Pac-10 First Team and was named Honorable Mention All-America by The Associated Press. He collected three triple-doubles that season, joining Jason Kidd as the only two players in Pac-10 history to post two or more triple-doubles in a season. During his career at Arizona, the Wildcats made it to the NCAA Tournament both seasons. In his freshman year the Wildcats were defeated in the Elite Eight by Kansas. In his sophomore year, Arizona was defeated in the first round by Seton Hall. After posting career totals of 594 points (9.6 ppg), 409 rebounds (6.6 rpg) and 95 steals (1.53 spg) in 62 games (34 starts) he left to enter the NBA draft. At Arizona, Iguodala planned to major in education.After the season, Iguodala signed with agent Rob Pelinka, co-founder of the Landmark Sports Agency, who had represented NBA All-Stars such as Kobe Bryant, Carlos Boozer and Gerald Wallace. Iguodala was selected 9th overall in the 2004 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. When Iguodala was selected, ESPN personality Dick Vitale commented that it was a mistake for the Sixers to take him, saying ""Iguodala was a [27 percent] shooter from the college three-point line. He's not going to be able to play"", Iguodala used this as motivation in what proved to be a very productive rookie season. Iguodala was thrust into the starting lineup immediately during his rookie season and was the only 76er to play and start all 82 regular season games plus 5 playoff games, becoming a favorite target of Allen Iverson in the process, often connecting on highlight-reel dunks on passes or alley-oops from Iverson. Iguodala proved his versatility, as he was the only rookie and 76er to record a triple-double that season, doing it against the defending champion Detroit Pistons. In the game, he scored 10 points, caught 10 rebounds and dished out 10 assists. During the season, he averaged 9 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3 assists, 1.7 steals, and 32.8 minutes per game. His efforts were rewarded when he was named to the All-Rookie First Team and started on the rookie team during the Rookie Challenge portion of All-Star Weekend. He finished fourth in voting for NBA Rookie of the Year. Now a permanent fixture in the 76ers starting rotation, Iguodala was the only Sixer to play in and start all 82 games in his second season. On February 17, 2006, at the Rookie Challenge, Iguodala won MVP honors for his 30-point performance in the Sophomores win. A day later, he participated in the Slam Dunk Contest. His first dunk was a simple windmill, but then for his second dunk he received a pass from Allen Iverson off the back side of the backboard, then leapt under the board and put in the reverse on the other side and was awarded a perfect score of 50 points. In the final round he did a behind-the-back dunk and followed with a reverse. The award however was given to Nate Robinson, in a controversial decision, as Robinson had missed 14 straight dunk attempts before hitting his final one. Iguodala averaged 12.3 points and 5.9 rebounds on the season. After Allen Iverson was traded to the Denver Nuggets and Chris Webber was released, Iguodala would have to get accustomed to his new leadership role with the 76ers. At the time of Webber's release, the Sixers were 9–26 (Iverson only played 15 games before he was traded). With Iguodala now averaging 40.3 minutes per game, he led the Sixers on a late season run, finishing the rest of the season 26–21 and almost clinching the 8th seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs (although their late run came more as a result of other teams ""tanking"" to secure a higher draft pick). He went on to finish the season with averages of 18.2 points, along with 5.7 rebounds and 5.7 assists. He was one of four players to average at least 18 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists, with the others being LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Tracy McGrady. Iguodala got off to a slow start to the season, even to a point where he was leading the league in turnovers. He began to step up his game as the season went on, leading Philadelphia to a playoff berth. The 76ers finished the season at 40–42, winning 22 of their last 29 games and earning a playoff spot with a victory over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4. Iguodala averaged a career-high 19.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4.8 assists per game through the 82 games. Philadelphia was set to face the #2 seed Detroit. In the playoffs the Sixers lost in the first round to the Pistons in 6 games after leading the series 2–1. Iguodala had a poor playoffs series, averaging 13 points per game. On August 12, 2008, Iguodala reportedly agreed to a six-year, $80 million contract extension with the Sixers. He officially signed on August 17, 2008. The contract had $5 million in bonuses and a player option for the sixth year. Early on in the year, Iguodala was on a Sixers team with high expectations after signing All-Star forward Elton Brand and seeing the success of forward Thaddeus Young, whom they drafted with their lottery pick the prior year. Iguodala developed into more of a primary player in the 2008–09 season, becoming more active as a facilitator on the offensive end of the floor. Early into the season, Philadelphia was struggling, which led to the departure of head coach Maurice Cheeks. The 76ers played much better basketball under Tony DiLeo. In his last year with co-captain and veteran point guard Andre Miller, Iguodala helped lead the Sixers to another playoff berth, finishing the season with a 41–41 season record, 6th in the Eastern conference. In the playoffs the 76ers were set to face the third seed Orlando Magic. In Game 1, Orlando had an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter, but Philadelphia made an amazing comeback led by Iguodala, eventually scoring a step-back, fadeaway jumper in the face of Hedo Türkoğlu with 2.2 seconds remaining to give the Sixers the win. Unfortunately, the Sixers eventually fell to the Magic in the Playoffs, failing to reach the second round. Iguodala had averaged 18.8 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game through 82 regular-season games. In the preseason Philadelphia drafted point guard Jrue Holiday out of UCLA to take over the void left at point guard after the departure of veteran point guard Andre Miller, who had joined the Portland Trail Blazers. The Sixers hired coach Eddie Jordan to take over for Tony DiLeo. Iguodala averaged career-highs in rebounds, assists, and blocks, and a career low in personal fouls. He finished the season averaging 17.1 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 5.8 apg, and 1.7 spg. The Sixers, however, were a big disappointment, going only 27–55 during the regular season and missing the playoffs after two straight playoff berths. During the season the 76ers brought Iguodala's old friend Allen Iverson back in what would be his final season in the NBA before going to play overseas for Beşiktaş. Coming into the 2010–11 NBA season, the 76ers were expected to rebound from their poor season. The Sixers fired head coach Eddie Jordan and brought in Doug Collins. Philadelphia also traded veteran big man Samuel Dalembert to the Sacramento Kings for a younger center Spencer Hawes; the 76ers also acquired Andrés Nocioni in the deal. With the second overall pick in the draft, the Sixers made a big splash by drafting Evan Turner. Philadelphia started the season poorly but were one of the best teams down the stretch. During the season, Iguodala was hampered by an Achilles injury, leading to career lows in games played and started, field-goal percentage, free-throw percentage, and steals per game as the 76ers finished with a 41–41 record. However, he also had his career-best season in assists with 6.3 apg and helped the Sixers make the playoffs with the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. During the year, Andre was the subject of multiple trade rumors that had him being traded to either the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers or Los Angeles Lakers. In the playoffs, Iguodala had the assignment of guarding LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in the first round. The 76ers were eventually defeated in 5 games. For his defensive efforts throughout the season, Iguodala was named to the NBA All-Defensive Team Second Team, though his coaches and teammates lobbied for him to make the First Team. He showed his versatility during the season posting up a career high in triple-doubles. Iguodala was second behind LeBron James for most triple-doubles during the 2010–11 season. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Iguodala had a week-long internship with Merrill Lynch. On his 28th birthday, Iguodala recorded a 10-point, 10-rebound, 10-assist triple-double effort in a win over the Pistons. Later that season, he was selected to his first All-Star Game as a reserve. His scoring average was the lowest of all the 24 All-Stars, but he was rewarded for being the best player on the 76ers, who were leading the Atlantic Division. Collins called him a ""stat-sheet stuffer"". At the end of the 2011–12 NBA season, Iguodala averaged 12.4 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 5.5 apg, 1.7 spg in 35.6 mpg. He helped the Philadelphia 76ers clinch the final seed in the playoffs. In Game 6 of the Sixers' first round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls, he made two free throws with 2.2 seconds left to win the game and help the Sixers upset the Bulls en route to the franchise's first playoff series win since 2003. This was also the fifth time in NBA history that an eighth seed defeated a first seed in the opening round of the playoffs. They were eventually eliminated by the Boston Celtics in a thrilling seven games in the Conference Semifinals. On August 10, 2012, Andre was dealt to the Denver Nuggets in a series of trades also involving the Sixers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Orlando Magic. Other players involved in the deal included All-Stars Andrew Bynum and Dwight Howard. His arrival in Denver led to some league experts labeling Denver a contender. Iguodala returned on opening night of 2012–13 to play his former team. He put up 11 points in an 84–75 loss, and received a mixed response from the crowd. The Nuggets went on to make the playoffs with a franchise record 57-25, and a team record 15 consecutive wins. However, they were upset in the first round by the Golden State Warriors, despite Iguodala having a good series, averaging 18 points, 8 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 2 steals per game in the series. This led to the firing of Nuggets coach George Karl, who just won the NBA Coach of the Year Award. In July 2013, Iguodala declined a five-year deal with Denver and agreed to a four-year for a reported $48 million with the Golden State Warriors. He officially joined the Warriors in a three-team sign-and-trade deal with the Nuggets and the Utah Jazz. On November 14, Iguodala made the game-winning, buzzer-beating shot in the Warriors' 116-115 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. Getting the inbound pass from Klay Thompson, Iguodala turned and made the fade-away jump shot over the Thunder's Thabo Sefolosha. Iguodala finished with 14 points and 9 assists. When playing against the Los Angeles Lakers on November 23, 2013, Iguodala strained his left hamstring late in the third quarter. Unfortunately, Iguodala went on to miss twelve consecutive games. However, on December 17, 2013, Iguodala returned to action in a game against the New Orleans Pelicans. On January 3, 2014, Iguodala hit a game-winning, 3-point buzzer-beater in the Warriors' 101–100 win over the Atlanta Hawks. The win extended the Warriors' season-high winning streak to 8 games. For his defensive contributions to the Warriors, Iguodala was named to the 2014 All-NBA Defensive first team. Entering the 2014–15 season, first-year Warriors coach Steve Kerr elected to move Iguodala from the starting rotation to the sixth man reserve position, in favor of forward Harrison Barnes. Since entering the NBA, Iguodala had played in 806 games as a starter without entering a game as a reserve, a league high over that span. On March 18, 2015, he scored a then season-high 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting in a 114-95 win over the Atlanta Hawks. The Warriors advanced to the 2015 NBA Finals to face Cleveland, where he was the team's best defender against Cavaliers star LeBron James. With Golden State down 2–1 in the series, Iguodala made his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. Iguodala scored a season-high 22 points on 8-of-15 shooting, which included four 3-pointers. The Warriors' small lineup, which came to be known as the Death Lineup, helped turn the series around. The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named the Finals MVP, becoming first player to win the award without starting a game during the regular season. He was also the first MVP to not have started every game in the Finals. He finished the series averaging 16.3 points, 4 assists, and 5.8 rebounds. When Iguodala was in the game, James made only 38.1% of his shots, compared to 44% without Iguodala. On November 11, 2015, Iguodala scored a season-high 20 points against the Memphis Grizzlies to help the Warriors begin the season 9–0. The Warriors' NBA-record start ended after 24 wins when they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks 108–95 on December 12. An ankle injury suffered in early March forced Igoudala to miss 13 straight games. The Warriors finished the regular season as the first seed in the Western Conference with a 73–9 record, the best overall record in NBA history, surpassing the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls' mark of 72–10, while Iguodala finished as runner-up for the 2015–16 NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award. In the first round of the playoffs, the Warriors faced the eighth-seeded Houston Rockets, and in a Game 4 win on April 24, Iguodala scored a season-high 22 points. The Warriors went on to defeat the Rockets in five games. In the second round, Iguodala helped the Warriors defeat the Portland Trail Blazers in five games to qualify for the Western Conference Finals. In their conference finals match-up with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Iguodala helped the Warriors fight back from a 3–1 deficit in the series to win clinch a 4–3 victory. In Game 6 of the series, Iguodala's defense on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook was key to the Warriors forcing Game 7. In Game 7, Iguodala started in place of Harrison Barnes and again marked Kevin Durant. With a Game 7 victory, the Warriors moved on to the NBA Finals for the second straight year. The Warriors would again play the Cleveland Cavaliers for the championship. Despite the Warriors going up 3–1 in the series following a Game 4 win, they went on to lose the series in seven games to become the first team in NBA history to lose the championship series after being up 3–1. On November 28, 2016, Iguodala had a season-best game with 12 points, five rebounds and five assists in a 105–100 win over the Atlanta Hawks, helping the Warriors start the season 16–2 while recording their 12th straight victory—their equal third-longest streak in franchise history. On January 16, 2017, he came off the bench to make all five of his field goal attempts for a season-high 14 points in a 126–91 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. In February 2017, long-time agent Rob Pelinka was appointed as the new general manager for the Los Angeles Lakers; Iguodala chose to remain with the Landmark Sports Agency, and co-founder Brandon Rosenthal took over as Iguodala's agent. On March 6, 2017, he set a new season high with 24 points in a 119–111 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On March 13, 2017, he was fined $10,000 by the NBA for using racially intemperate language in an interview following the Warriors' loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on March 10. The Warriors finished the season as the first seed in the West with a 67–15 record. Following a 129–115 victory in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals over the Spurs, the Warriors reached their third straight NBA Finals series while becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12–0. Iguodala was a key bench player during the 2017 NBA Finals, often guarding LeBron James and scored 20 points in Game 5, helping the Warriors win the championship by defeating the Cavaliers in five games. Iguodala entered the 2017 off-season as a free agent and held meetings with numerous competing teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Sacramento Kings, and Houston Rockets. However, on July 25, 2017, Iguodala re-signed with the Warriors on a three-year, $48 million contract. On December 11, 2017 against the Portland Trail Blazers, Iguodala played his 1,000th regular-season game, becoming one of 126 players in NBA history to accomplish the feat. Iguodala played in Game 3 of the 2018 NBA Finals after missing the final four games of the Western Conference Finals and the first two games of the NBA Finals with a left lateral leg contusion. The Warriors went on to win their third championship in four years with a sweep of the Cavaliers. Iguodala averaged a career-low 5.7 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists in the regular season. During the playoffs, he boosted his averages to 9.8 points, 4.3 rebounds and 4.0 assists, while also starting a majority of the games. In a sign of respect towards their opponent and with an increased urgency, Kerr opened the conference semifinals against Houston by moving Iguodala from the bench and starting their Hamptons Five lineup for the first time in the season. After starting nine consecutive games, he missed the deciding Game 4 in the conference finals against Portland with a sore left calf injury from Game 3. The Warriors returned to the NBA Finals for the fifth straight season, but lost in six games to the Toronto Raptors. In a 114–110 series-ending loss in Game 6, Iguodala had 22 points for his best scoring output of the postseason. However, Thompson left the game after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, and Durant was already sidelined after rupturing his right Achilles tendon in Game 5. On July 7, 2019, Golden State traded Iguodala along with a protected first round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Julian Washburn. The Warriors received a traded player exception in the deal. Golden State was eyeing a replacement for Thompson while he recovered from his injury, and the trade freed salary cap space for them to acquire All-Star guard D'Angelo Russell in a sign-and-trade package with the Brooklyn Nets for Durant, who had announced earlier that he planned to sign with the Nets. Afterwards, the Warriors stated that they planned to eventually retire Iguodala's No. 9 jersey. The Grizzlies, who were rebuilding, reached an agreement before training camp to allow Iguodala to stay away from the team and train on his own. They kept him on their 15-man opening day roster instead of buying out the 35-year-old veteran, who was earning $17 million in the last year of his contract. Memphis was hoping for a quality trade with a playoff contender in exchange for Iguodala and his championship experience. On February 6, 2020, Iguodala was traded to the Miami Heat in a 3-team trade. Iguodala was a member of the United States national team in the 2010 FIBA World Championship, winning the gold medal. In the FIBA World Championships Iguodala displayed his athleticism with an array of fastbreak dunks. Iguodala was also selected for the 2012 London Olympics team, largely due to his exceptional defensive ability. He helped Team USA win the gold medal against Spain in a 107–100 victory. Coach Mike Krzyzewski called Iguodala one of the team's best players, and compared his game to that of Scottie Pippen. He also won a bronze medal with the U.S. at the FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship in 2002. In August 2015, Iguodala married his childhood sweetheart, Christina Gutierrez, at One&Only Palmilla in Los Cabos, Mexico. Iguodala has a daughter, London, and a son, Andre Jr. Iguodala is a Christian. He has said, ""Faith is something I heavily lean on to give me that balance. I make sure I stay in chapel and have a good relationship with our chaplain. It keeps me focused … When people see us on the court, we want them to see God's work. We want to be a good representation of what we believe in …When you go out there, you’re not just representing your country or the NBA, you’re representing your beliefs. You want to play hard for someone who died for you"". The Sporting News named Iguodala one of ""the good guys of 2006"" for establishing the Andre Iguodala Disaster Relief Fund that raised money for tornado victims in his hometown of Springfield, Illinois.He later established the Andre Iguodala Youth Foundation, whose stated mission is to use sports as a means to help youths. The organization has hosted basketball camps and the annual ""Thanksgiving with Dre"", which has distributed food baskets to families in need. Alongside former teammate Stephen Curry, Iguodala is known to be an avid golfer. Iguodala enjoys playing video games, particularly the NBA 2K series. He played in a tournament put together at the NBA 2K10 launch party in New York City against other NBA players Nate Robinson, Brook Lopez and Rajon Rondo, and rapper Wale. In March 2015, Twice, an online secondhand apparel outlet, named Iguodala its Menswear Style Director. Iguodala is a tech-investor and a leading advocate for athletes in the NBA to invest in the technology industry. His partnership with entrepreneurs in San Francisco's Silicon Valley has led to an annual event tagged Players Technology Summit. The inaugural edition of the event began in 2017 where Iguodala and teammate Stephen Curry played hosts. The second edition saw other athletes from the NBA like Kevin Durant and Jaylen Brown make debuts. The Players Technology Summit, sponsored by Bloomberg, was established as a platform to set a discourse and help shape conversations for athletes' financial future through opportunities in the technology industry. Together with partner Rudy Cline-Thomas, Iguodala has been able to invest in companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Tesla. The two have also invested in at least 25 different startups in the technology industry. On June 25, 2019, Iguodala released The Sixth Man: A Memoir.",26354,1994,2019-20,4.0,0.0,87.0,3.3,6.6,0.5,1.7,5.0,0.333,1.7,1.7,1.0,0.4,1.2,0.333,2.5,6.2,8.7,3.3,0.8,1.2,2.1,4.6,8.7,16.0,Miami Heat

They have two daughters, Xenia and Catherine, both born in Milwaukee. Since the 2003 Turkish Junior Basketball Championship held in Konya, there has been some controversy to İlyasova's age and national origin. The controversy is fueled by the claim that a man named Arsen Ilyasov, born in 1984 in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, entered Turkey as an 18-year-old in August 7, 2002 and was never heard from again, while on September 19, 2002, a man named Semsettin Bulut claimed to have forgotten to register the birth of his now 15-year-old son, and did so as Ersan İlyasova, a Turkish citizen. This claim, that İlyasova is actually Ilyasov and should be an Uzbek player, was officially put forth by the Uzbekistan Basketball Federation in a grievance, but FIBA ruled in the Turkish Basketball Federation's favor. While this controversy was brewing, some media outlets, such as ESPN's Chad Ford, openly referred to Ilyasova as ""The 17-year-old forward from Uzbekistan is widely considered the best prospect to ever come out of Turkey."" Other biographies, while not claiming an Uzbek birth, still maintain a 1984 birth year.",26355,1998,2019-20,51.0,7.0,823.0,5.8,12.3,0.472,1.9,5.2,0.373,3.9,7.2,0.543,2.7,3.2,0.836,2.4,8.7,11.1,2.0,1.0,0.6,1.3,3.5,16.2,17.0,Milwaukee Bucks

On January 19, 2010, Irving was selected to the 2010 Junior National Select Team. The team played at the 2010 Nike Hoop Summit at the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon, on April 10. He was also selected to play in the 2010 McDonald's All-American Game and the 2010 Jordan Brand Classic, where he was named co-MVP with Harrison Barnes. In June 2010, Irving was a part of the United States gold medal winning team at the FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship. Irving committed to Duke on October 22, 2009, in a television broadcast on ESPNU. Irving played with the Blue Devils during the 2010–11 basketball season under the guidance of head coach Mike Krzyzewski. Through the first eight games of the season, he averaged 17.4 points per game on 53.2% shooting, 5.1 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 1.5 steals. Irving was a strong contender for NCAA Freshman of the Year until he suffered a severe ligament injury in his right big toe during the ninth game of the season. On March 17, the day before Duke played Hampton in the first round of the NCAA tournament, he returned for his first game since his injury. Duke advanced to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament but fell to Arizona. Irving scored 28 points in what turned out to be his last game for Duke. Irving announced that he would forgo his final three seasons of eligibility and enter the 2011 NBA draft, where he was selected with the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Irving was named to the 2012 Rising Stars Challenge, where he played for Team Chuck. Irving scored 34 points in the game, going 8-of-8 from three-point range, and earned MVP honors. He also won the 2012 NBA Rookie of the Year Award with 117 of a possible 120 first-place votes. He was the only unanimous selection to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. For the season, Irving averaged 18.5 points, 5.4 assists and shot 46.9% from the field, including 39.9% on three-pointers. At a Las Vegas Cavaliers practice on July 14, 2012, Irving sustained a broken right hand after reportedly slapping it against a padded wall after committing a turnover. ""I am a little disappointed"", he said. ""I have to be more responsible about my health. It was just crazy. It happened so fast."" It was announced that Irving would require hand surgery on July 18. At the start of the 2012–13 NBA season, Irving injured his index finger in a loss to the Dallas Mavericks. He played in the Cavaliers' next game, but the injury forced him to miss three weeks of action. In his second game back, while donning a black protective face mask to protect a broken bone he suffered against Milwaukee, Irving scored his then career-high 41 points against the New York Knicks. He became the youngest player in NBA history to score 40 points in Madison Square Garden; he was a year younger than Michael Jordan, who did it in 1985. The coaches selected Irving to play in his first All-Star game. He finished with 15 points, 4 assists, and 3 rebounds. He also participated in the Rising Stars Challenge again, scoring 32 points for Team Shaq in a losing effort. Irving participated in the NBA NBA Three-Point Shootout and recorded 23 points in the final round to win the event. He ended his second season with averages of 22.5 points, 5.9 assists, 3.7 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game Fans chose Irving to be the starting point guard for the Eastern Conference in the 2014 NBA All-Star game. He was the All-Star game MVP, recording 31 points and 14 assists as the East beat the West 163–155. On February 28, 2014, Irving recorded his first career triple-double with 21 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 99–79 win over the Utah Jazz.

Irving averaged 20.8 points, 6.1 assists, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.5 steals on the season. On July 10, 2014, Irving signed a five-year, $90 million contract extension with the Cavaliers. His contract extension came in the wake of LeBron James's return to Cleveland and Kevin Love's trade request from Minnesota, as the trio teamed up to start a new ""Big Three"" in Cleveland. After a shaky start to the season, in which they fell to a record of 5–7 after a November 22 loss to Toronto, the Cavaliers went on an eight-game winning streak during which Irving averaged 19.3 points per game, including a 37-point game against the New York Knicks on December 4. After their streak-ending loss on December 11 to Oklahoma City, the Cavaliers went on to win just five more games in December, finishing 2014 at 18–14. All of the new Big Three missed time during December, contributing to team's inconsistency and mediocre play. The Cavaliers began their 2015 schedule on January 2 as they snapped a three-game losing streak with Irving's help. He scored 23 points, and with Love's 27, the Cavaliers defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 91–87. The Cavaliers' next game, against Dallas on January 4, was a season low for Irving, who scored just six points before leaving in the third quarter with lower back tightness; the Cavaliers lost, 109–90. Irving missed the next game, against Philadelphia, before returning to action on January 7 against Houston to tie a then first-half career high of 23 points. He finished the game with a then season-high 38 points, but could not lead the Cavaliers to a win as they lost 105–93, the team's seventh loss in nine games. After a six-game losing streak between January 4 and 13 dropped the Cavaliers to 19–20, Irving and James led them on a 12-game winning streak to bring them back into contention. During the streak, Irving averaged 24.5 points per game, including a then career-high 55 points on January 28 against Portland. His 11 three-pointers in that game set a Cavaliers franchise record while his 55 points were the second-most in Cavaliers history (behind James's 56) and the most scored in a home game, as well as the most points scored in Quicken Loans Arena history. His 28 first-half points also set a new career high for points in a half. On March 12, 2015, Irving scored a career-high 57 points, including a buzzer-beating three-point shot to send the Cavaliers into overtime, in a 128–125 win over the San Antonio Spurs. It was the most points for a player in a regular-season game against the defending champion since January 14, 1962, when Wilt Chamberlain scored 62 points for the Philadelphia Warriors in a loss to the Celtics. The effort also surpassed the Cavaliers' franchise single-game scoring mark of 56 points, set by LeBron James against the Toronto Raptors on March 3, 2005. Irving helped the Cavaliers win 34 of their final 43 games to finish the regular season as the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference with a 53–29 overall record. In his first career playoff game on April 19, Irving scored 30 points in a 113–100 win over the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of their first-round playoff matchup. He went on to help the Cavaliers reach the NBA Finals for just the second time in franchise history despite missing two games in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Atlanta Hawks with a knee injury. After leaving Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors in the overtime period with a knee injury, Irving was ruled out for the rest of the series the following day with a fractured left kneecap that required surgery, sidelining him for three to four months. The team lost the series to the Warriors in six games. On August 27, 2015, Irving was ruled unlikely to be ready for opening night of the 2015–16 season due to the left kneecap fracture he suffered in Game 1 of the 2015 NBA Finals. He made his season debut on December 20, scoring 12 points in 17 minutes as a starter against the Philadelphia 76ers.

He tied that mark with another 31-point game in Game 4 of the series, helping the Cavaliers sweep the Pistons. The Cavaliers went on to breeze through the Eastern Conference playoffs with a 12–2 record to reach the 2016 NBA Finals, where they faced the Golden State Warriors for the second straight year. Irving struggled with his shot in his debut Finals game, going 7-of-22 from the field for 26 points, as the Cavaliers were defeated 104–89 in Game 1. Facing a 3–1 deficit following a Game 4 loss, Irving and LeBron James took over in Game 5, each scoring 41 points to lead the Cavaliers to a 112–97 win, forcing a Game 6. Irving and James became the first teammates to each score 40 points in an NBA Finals game. In Game 7, Irving hit a three-pointer with 53 seconds left in the game that propelled the Cavaliers to a 92–89 lead and an eventual 93–89 win. The Cavaliers won the series 4–3 and became the first team to rally from a 3–1 finals deficit, beating the defending champion Golden State Warriors to end a 52-year major sports championship drought in Cleveland. On October 25, 2016, after receiving his first championship ring prior to the season opener, Irving scored a game-high 29 points in a 117–88 win over the New York Knicks. Three days later, he scored 26 points and hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 44.3 seconds remaining to lift the Cavaliers to a 94–91 win over the Toronto Raptors.

With 24 points in Game 5 of the series, he helped the Cavaliers defeat the Celtics 135–102 to claim their third straight Eastern Conference title and a return trip to the NBA Finals. After going down 3–0 in the 2017 NBA Finals, Irving scored 40 points in Game 4 to help Cleveland extend the series and avoid a sweep with a 137–116 win over the Golden State Warriors. The Cavaliers went on to lose to the Warriors in Game 5, thus losing the series 4–1. In July 2017, Irving requested the Cavaliers to trade him, reportedly wanting to be more of the focal point of his own team instead of continuing to play alongside LeBron James. The next month, on August 22, he was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić, and the rights to the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first-round draft pick. Eight days later, the Celtics agreed to send the Cavaliers a 2020 second-round draft pick via the Miami Heat to complete the trade, as compensation for Thomas' failed physical. In his debut for the Celtics in their season opener against the Cavaliers on October 17, 2017, Irving had 22 points and 10 assists in a 102–99 loss. He had a chance to tie it with a 3-pointer at the horn but missed. On October 30, 2017, he scored 24 points for the third straight game in helping the Celtics defeat the San Antonio Spurs 108–94.

On November 20, 2017, he scored 10 of his season-high 47 points in overtime as the Celtics rallied from a double-digit deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 110–102, extending their winning streak to 16 games. The streak ended at 16 games with a loss to the Miami Heat two days later. On January 21, 2018, he scored 40 points in a 103–95 loss to the Orlando Magic. The Celtics had accumulated a 34–10 record by mid-January, but their loss to Orlando was their season-worst third straight defeat. On January 27, 2018, he scored 37 points on 13-for-18 shooting with five 3-pointers in a 109–105 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On February 28, 2018, Irving helped the Celtics improve to 4–0 following the All-Star break with a 134–106 win over the Charlotte Hornets.

Less than two weeks later, he was ruled out for the entire postseason, with a recovery time of four to five months, after another procedure was scheduled to remove two screws from his patella that were inserted in 2015 to repair a fracture he suffered during that year's NBA Finals. In the Celtics' season opener on October 16, Irving played in his first game since March and had seven points and seven assists in a 105–87 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.

On November 16, he recorded a season-high 43 points and 11 assists in a 123–116 overtime win over the Toronto Raptors.

However, in 2016, having not achieved his degree, he claimed he was putting his plans on hold, stating, ""when I leave the game of basketball, then I'll focus on the next step of my life"". In 2015, he launched his PSD Underwear collection. In November 2016, Irving tweeted his support for the water protectors at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation who were demonstrating against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota.

In February 2017, Irving stated in an interview for a podcast that he believes that the Earth is flat. In a later interview, he was less forceful in advancing his flat Earth belief, encouraging people to ""do their own research"" into the topic. In September 2017, Irving denied these claims and said that media misunderstood him as he was joking. However, in a June 2018 interview, when asked if he would admit that the world is round he said ""I don't know. I really don't"", and added that people should ""do [their] own research for what [they] want to believe in"" because ""Our educational system is flawed."" In October 2018, Irving apologized for his original flat Earth comments. Irving also stated that he believes in other conspiracy theories, such as the idea that John F. Kennedy was killed by the Federal Reserve, and that the CIA tried to kill Bob Marley.",26358,2009,2019-20,20.0,20.0,658.0,10.9,22.8,0.478,3.1,7.8,0.394,7.8,15.0,0.522,5.1,5.6,0.922,1.2,4.4,5.6,7.0,1.5,0.5,2.8,2.9,30.0,3.0,Brooklyn Nets

For football, Jackson was recruited by Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, all of whom were willing to break the color barrier just for Jackson. (Oklahoma had black football players before 1964, including Prentice Gautt, a star running back recruited in 1957, who played in the NFL.) Jackson declined Alabama and Georgia because he was fearful of the South at the time, and declined Oklahoma because they told him to stop dating white girls. For baseball, Jackson was scouted by Hans Lobert of the San Francisco Giants who was desperate to sign him. The Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins also made offers, and the hometown Philadelphia Phillies gave him a tryout but declined because of his ""hitting skills"". His father wanted his son to go to college, where Jackson wanted to play both football and baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from Arizona State University in Tempe; his high school football coach knew ASU's head football coach Frank Kush, and they discussed the possibility of his playing both sports. After a recruiting trip, Kush decided that Jackson had the ability and willingness to work to join the squad. One day after football practice, he approached ASU baseball coach Bobby Winkles and asked if he could join the team. Winkles said he would give Jackson a look, and the next day while still in his football gear, he hit a home run on the second pitch he saw; in five at bats he hit three home runs. He was allowed to practice with the team, but could not join the squad because the NCAA had a rule forbidding the use of freshman players. Jackson switched permanently to baseball following his freshman year, as he did not want to become a defensive back. To hone his skills, Winkles assigned him to a Baltimore Orioles-affiliated amateur team. He broke numerous team records for the squad, and the Orioles offered him a $50,000 signing bonus if he joined the team. Jackson declined the offer stating that he did not want to forfeit his college scholarship. In the beginning of his sophomore year in 1966, Jackson replaced Rick Monday (the first player ever selected in the Major League Baseball draft and a future teammate with the A's) at center field. He broke the team record for most home runs in a single season, led the team in numerous other categories and was first team All-American. Many scouts were looking at him play, including Tom Greenwade of the New York Yankees (who discovered Mickey Mantle), and Danny Murtaugh of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In his final game at Arizona State, he showed his potential by being only a triple away from hitting for the cycle, making a sliding catch, and having an assist at home plate. Jackson was the first college player to hit a home run out of Phoenix Municipal Stadium. In the 1966 Major League Baseball draft on June 7, Jackson was selected by the Kansas City Athletics. He was the second overall pick, behind 17-year-old catcher Steve Chilcott, who was taken by the New York Mets. According to Jackson, Winkles told him that the Mets did not select him because he had a white girlfriend. Winkles later denied the story, stating that he did not know the reason why Jackson was not drafted by the Mets. It was later confirmed by Joe McDonald that the Mets drafted Chilcott because of need, the person running the Mets at the time was George Weiss, so the true motive may never be known. Jackson, age 20, signed with the A's for $95,000 on June 13 and reported for his first training camp with the Lewis-Clark Broncs of the short season Single-A Northwest League in Lewiston, Idaho, managed by Grady Wilson. He made his professional debut as a center fielder in the season opener on June 24 at Bethel Park in Eugene, Oregon, but was hitless in five at-bats. In the next game, Jackson singled in the first inning and homered in the ninth. In the home opener at Bengal Field in Lewiston on June 30, he hit a double and a triple. In his final game as a Bronc on July 6, Jackson was hit in the head by a pitch in the first inning, but stayed in the game and drove in runs with two sacrifice flies. Complaining of a headache, he left the game in the ninth inning, was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital in Lewiston, and remained overnight for observation. Jackson played for two Class A teams in 1966, with the Broncs for just 12 games, and then 56 games with Modesto in the California League, where he hit 21 homers. He began 1967 with the Birmingham A's in the Double-A Southern League in Birmingham, Alabama, where Jackson got his first taste of racism, being one of only a few blacks on the team. He credits the team's manager at the time, John McNamara, for helping him through that difficult season. Jackson debuted in the major leagues with the A's in 1967 in a Friday doubleheader in Kansas City on June 9, a shutout sweep of the Cleveland Indians by scores of 2–0 and 6–0 at Municipal Stadium. (Jackson had his first career hit in the nightcap, a lead-off triple in the fifth inning off of long reliever Orlando Peña.) The Athletics moved west to Oakland prior to the 1968 season. Jackson hit 47 home runs in 1969, and was briefly ahead of the pace that Roger Maris set when he broke the single-season record for home runs with 61 in 1961, and that of Babe Ruth when he set the previous record of 60 in 1927. Jackson later said that the sportswriters were claiming he was ""dating a lady named 'Ruth Maris.'"" Slumping at the plate in May 1970, Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley threatened to send Jackson to the minors. Jackson hit 23 home runs while batting .237 for the 1970 season. The Athletics sent him to play in Puerto Rico, where he played for the Santurce team and hit 20 homers and knocked in 47 runs to lead the league in both departments. Jackson hit a memorable home run in the 1971 All-Star Game at Tiger Stadium in Detroit. Batting for the American League against Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Dock Ellis, the ball he hit soared above the right-field stands, striking the transformer of a light standard on the right field roof. While with the Angels in 1984, he hit a home run over that roof. In 1971, the Athletics won the American League's West division, their first title of any kind since 1931, when they played in Philadelphia. They were swept in three games in the American League Championship Series by the Baltimore Orioles. The A's won the division again in 1972; their series with the Tigers went the full five games, and Jackson scored the tying run in the clincher on a steal of home. In the process, however, he tore a hamstring and was unable to play in the World Series. The A's still managed to defeat the Cincinnati Reds in seven games. It was the first championship won by a San Francisco Bay Area team in any major league sport. During spring training in 1972, Jackson showed up with a mustache. Though his teammates wanted him to shave it off, Jackson refused. Finley liked the mustache so much that he offered each player $300 to grow one, and hosted a ""Mustache Day"" featuring the last MLB player to wear a mustache, Frenchy Bordagaray, as master of ceremonies. Jackson helped the Athletics win the pennant again in 1973, and was named Most Valuable Player of the American League for the season. The A's defeated the New York Mets in seven hard-fought games in the World Series. This time, Jackson was not only able to play, but his performance led to his being awarded the Series' MVP award. In the third inning of that seventh game, which ended in a 5–2 score, the A's jumped out to a 4–0 lead as both Bert Campaneris and Jackson hit two-run home runs off Jon Matlack—the only two home runs Oakland hit the entire Series. The A's won the World Series again in 1974, defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. Besides hitting 254 home runs in nine years with the Athletics, Jackson was also no stranger to controversy or conflict in Oakland. Sports author Dick Crouser wrote, ""When the late Al Helfer was broadcasting the Oakland A's games, he was not too enthusiastic about Reggie Jackson's speed or his hustle. Once, with Jackson on third, teammate Rick Monday hit a long home run. 'Jackson should score easily on that one,' commented Helfer. Crouser also noted that, ""Nobody seems to be neutral on Reggie Jackson. You're either a fan or a detractor."" When teammate Darold Knowles was asked if Jackson was a hotdog (i.e., a show-off), he famously replied, ""There isn't enough mustard in the world to cover Reggie Jackson."" In February 1974, Jackson won an arbitration case for a $135,000 salary for the season, nearly doubling his previous year's $70,000. On June 5, outfielder Billy North and Jackson engaged in a clubhouse fight at Detroit's Tiger Stadium. Jackson injured his shoulder, and catcher Ray Fosse, attempting to separate the combatants, suffered a crushed disk in his neck, costing him three months on the disabled list. In October, the A's went on to win a third consecutive World Series. Prior to the 1975 season, Jackson sought $168,000, but arbitration went against him this time and he settled for $140,000. The A's won a fifth consecutive division title, but the loss of pitcher Catfish Hunter, baseball's first modern free agent, left them vulnerable, and they were swept in the ALCS by the Boston Red Sox. With the coming of free agency after the 1976 season, and with Oakland owner Finley unwilling to pay the higher salary that Jackson would ask for, he was traded on April 2 in a six-player deal just prior to the start of the season. Along with pitcher Ken Holtzman and minor leaguer Bill VanBommell, Jackson went to the Baltimore Orioles for Don Baylor, Mike Torrez, and Paul Mitchell. Jackson had not signed a contract and threatened to sit out the season; he reported to the Orioles four weeks later, and made his first plate appearance on May 2. Baltimore and Oakland both finished second in their respective divisions in 1976; the Yankees and Royals advanced to the ALCS, the first without the A's since 1970. During Jackson's lone season in Baltimore he stole 28 bases, a career-best. The Yankees won the pennant in 1976 but were swept in the World Series by the Reds. A month later on November 29, they signed Jackson to a five-year contract totaling $2.96 million ($13,300,000 in current dollar terms). The number 9 that he had worn in Oakland and Baltimore was already used by Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles; Jackson asked for number 42 in memory of Jackie Robinson, but that number was given to pitching coach Art Fowler before the start of the season. Noting that Hank Aaron, at the time the holder of the career record for the most home runs, had just retired, Jackson asked for and received number 44 as a tribute to Aaron. Jackson wore number 20 for one game during spring training as a tribute to the also recently retired Frank Robinson, then he switched to number 44. Jackson's first season with the Yankees in 1977 was a difficult one. Although team owner George Steinbrenner and several players, most notably catcher and team captain Thurman Munson and outfielder Lou Piniella, were excited about his arrival, the team's field manager Billy Martin was not. Martin had managed the Tigers in 1972, when Jackson's A's beat them in the playoffs. Jackson was once quoted as saying of Martin, ""I hate him, but if I played for him, I'd probably love him."" The relationship between Jackson and his new teammates was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward. During spring training at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's version of the story is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one thing more to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be ""the straw that stirs the drink."" But when the story appeared in the June 1977 issue of SPORT, Ward quoted Jackson as saying, ""This team, it all flows from me. I'm the straw that stirs the drink. Maybe I should say me and Munson, but he can only stir it bad."" Jackson has consistently denied saying anything negative about Munson in the interview and he has said that his quotes were taken out of context. However, Dave Anderson of The New York Times subsequently wrote that he had drinks with Jackson in July 1977, and that Jackson told him, ""I'm still the straw that stirs the drink. Not Munson, not nobody else on this club."" Regardless, as Munson was beloved by his teammates, Martin, Steinbrenner and Yankee fans, the relationships between them and Jackson became very strained. On June 18, in a 10–4 loss to the Boston Red Sox in a nationally televised game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but notoriously slow runner, hit a ball into shallow right field that Jackson appeared to weakly attempt to field. Jackson failed to reach the ball, which fell far in front of him, thereby allowing Rice to reach second base. Furious, Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting for the end of the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. They argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being 18 years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly, and the NBC TV cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country. Yankees management defused the situation by the next day, but the relationship between Jackson and Martin was permanently poisoned. However, George Steinbrenner made a crucial intervention when he gave Martin the option of either having Jackson bat in the fourth or ""cleanup"" spot for the rest of the season, or losing his job. Martin made the change and Jackson's hitting improved (he had 13 home runs and 49 RBIs over his next 50 games), and the team went on a winning streak. On September 14, while in a tight three-way race for the American League Eastern Division crown with the Red Sox and Orioles, Jackson ended a game with the Red Sox by hitting a home run off Reggie Cleveland, giving the Yankees a 2–0 win. The Yankees won the division by two and a half games over the Red Sox and Orioles, and came from behind in the top of the ninth inning in the fifth and final game of the American League Championship Series to beat the Kansas City Royals for the pennant. During the World Series against the Dodgers, Munson was interviewed, and suggested that Jackson, because of his past post-season performances, might be the better interview subject. ""Go ask Mister October"", he said, giving Jackson a nickname that would stick. (In Oakland, he had been known as ""Jax"" and ""Buck."") Jackson hit home runs in Games Four and Five of the Series. Jackson's crowning achievement came with his three-home-run performance in World Series-clinching Game Six, each on the first pitch, off three Dodgers pitchers. (His first plate-appearance, during the second inning, resulted in a four-pitch walk.) The first came off starter Burt Hooton, and was a line drive shot into the lower right field seats at Yankee Stadium. The second was a much faster line drive off reliever Elías Sosa into roughly the same area. With the fans chanting his name, ""Reg-GIE! Reg-GIE! Reg-GIE!"" The third came off reliever Charlie Hough, a knuckleball pitcher, making the distance of this home run particularly remarkable. It was a towering drive into the black-painted batter's eye seats in center, 475 feet away. Jackson stated afterwards that the scouting reports provided by Gene Michael and Birdie Tebbetts played a large role in his success. Their reports indicated that the Dodgers would attempt to pitch him inside and Jackson was prepared. Since Jackson had hit a home run off Dodger pitcher Don Sutton in his last at bat in Game Five, his three home runs in Game Six meant that he had hit four home runs on four consecutive swings of the bat against as many Dodgers pitchers. Jackson became the first player to win the World Series MVP award for two teams. In 27 World Series games, he amassed 10 home runs, including a record five during the 1977 Series (the last three on first pitches), 24 RBI and a .357 batting average. Babe Ruth, Albert Pujols, and Pablo Sandoval are the only other players to hit three home runs in a single World Series game. Babe Ruth accomplishing the feat twice – in 1926 and 1928 (both in Game Four). With 25 total bases, Jackson also broke Ruth's record of 22 in the latter Series; this remains a World Series record, Willie Stargell tying it in the 1979 World Series. Chase Utley (2009, Philadelphia) and George Springer (2017, Houston) have since tied Jackson's record for most home runs in a single World Series. An often forgotten aspect of the ending of this decisive Game 6 was the way Jackson left the field at the game's end. Fans had been getting somewhat rowdy in anticipation of the game's end, and some had actually thrown firecrackers out near Jackson's area in right field. Jackson was alarmed enough about this to walk off the field, in order to get a helmet from the Yankee bench to protect himself. Shortly after this point, as the end of the game neared, fans were actually bold enough to climb over the wall, draping their legs over the side in preparation for the moment when they planned to rush onto the field. When that moment came, after pitcher Mike Torrez caught a pop-up for the game's final out, Jackson started running at top speed off the field, actually body-checking past some of these fans filling the playing field in the manner of a football linebacker. The Yankees' home opener of the 1978 season, on April 13 against the Chicago White Sox, featured a new product, the ""Reggie!"" bar. In 1976, while playing in Baltimore, Jackson had said, ""If I played in New York, they'd name a candy bar after me."" The Standard Brands company responded with a circular ""bar"" of peanuts dipped in caramel and covered in chocolate, a confection that was originally named the ""Wayne Bun"" as it was made in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The ""Reggie!"" bars were handed to fans as they walked into Yankee Stadium. Jackson hit a home run, and when he returned to right field the next inning, fans began throwing the Reggie bars on the field in celebration. Jackson told the press that this confused him, thinking that maybe the fans did not like the candy. The Yankees won the game, 4–2. But the Yankees could not maintain their success, as manager Billy Martin lost control. On July 23, after suspending Jackson for disobeying a sign during a July 17 game, Martin made a statement about his two main antagonists, referring to comments Jackson had made and team owner George Steinbrenner's 1972 violation of campaign-finance laws: ""They're made for each other. One's a born liar, the other's convicted."" It was moments like these that gave the Yankees the nickname ""The Bronx Zoo."" Martin resigned the next day (some sources have said he was actually fired), and was replaced by Bob Lemon, a Hall of Fame pitcher for the Cleveland Indians who had been recently fired as manager of the White Sox. Steinbrenner, a Cleveland-area native, had hired former Indians star Al Rosen as his team president (replacing another Cleveland figure, Gabe Paul). Steinbrenner jumped at the chance to involve another hero of his youth with the Yankees; Lemon had been one of Steinbrenner's coaches during the Bombers' pennant-winning 1976 season. After being 14 games behind the first-place Red Sox on July 18, the Yankees finished the season in a tie for first place. The two teams played a one-game playoff for the division title at Fenway Park, with the Yankees winning 5–4. Although the home run by light-hitting shortstop Bucky Dent in the seventh inning got the most notice, it was an eighth-inning home run by Jackson that gave the Yankees the fifth run they ended up needing. The next day, with the American League Championship Series with the Royals beginning, Jackson hit a home run off the Royals' top reliever at the time, Al Hrabosky, the flamboyant ""Mad Hungarian."" The Yankees won the pennant in four games, their third straight. Jackson was once again in the center of events in the World Series, again against the Dodgers. Los Angeles won the first two games at Dodger Stadium, taking the second when rookie reliever Bob Welch struck Jackson out with two men on base with two outs in the ninth inning. The series then moved to New York, and after the Yankees won Game Three on several fine defensive plays by third baseman Graig Nettles, Game Four saw Jackson in the middle of a controversial play on the basepaths. In the sixth inning, after collecting an RBI single, Jackson was struck in the hip–possibly on purpose–by a ball thrown by Dodger shortstop Bill Russell as Jackson was being forced at second base. Instead of completing a double play that would have ended the inning, the ball caromed into foul territory and allowed Thurman Munson to score the Yankees' second run of the inning. In spite of the Dodgers' protests of interference on Jackson's part, the umpires allowed the play to stand. The Yankees tied the game in the eighth inning and eventually won in the tenth. Following a blowout win in Game Five, both teams headed back to Los Angeles. In Game Six, Jackson got his revenge against Welch by blasting a two-run home run in the seventh inning, putting the finishing touch on a series-clinching, 7-2 win for the Yankees. In 1980, Jackson batted .300 for the only time in his career, and his 41 home runs tied with Ben Oglivie of the Milwaukee Brewers for the American League lead. However, the Yankees were swept in the ALCS by the Kansas City Royals. As he entered the last year of his Yankee contract in 1981, Jackson endured several difficulties from George Steinbrenner. After the owner consulted Jackson about signing then-free agent Dave Winfield, Jackson expected Steinbrenner to work out a new contract for him as well. Steinbrenner never did (some say never intending to) and Jackson played the season as a free agent. Jackson started slowly with the bat, and when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause in Jackson's contract forcing him to take a complete physical examination. Jackson was outraged and blasted Steinbrenner in the media. When the season resumed, Jackson's hitting improved, partly to show Steinbrenner he wasn't finished as a player. He hit a long home run into the upper deck in Game Five of the strike-forced 1981 American League Division Series with the Brewers, and the Yankees went on to win the pennant again. However, Jackson injured himself running the bases in Game Two of the 1981 ALCS and missed the first two games of the World Series, both of which the Yankees won. Jackson was medically cleared to play Game Three, but manager Bob Lemon refused to start him or even play him, allegedly acting under orders from Steinbrenner. The Yankees lost that game and Jackson played the remainder of the series, hitting a home run in Game Four. However, they lost the last three games and the World Series to the Dodgers. Jackson became a free-agent again once the 1981 season was over. The owner of the California Angels, entertainer Gene Autry, had heard of Jackson's desire to return to California to play, and signed him to a five-year contract. On April 27, 1982, in Jackson's first game back at Yankee Stadium with the Angels, he broke out of a terrible season-starting slump to hit a home run off former teammate Ron Guidry. The at-bat began with Yankee fans, angry at Steinbrenner for letting Jackson get away, starting the ""Reg-GIE!"" chant, and ended it with the fans chanting ""Steinbrenner sucks!"" By the time of Jackson's election to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner had begun to say that letting him go was the biggest mistake he had made as Yankee owner. That season, the Angels won the American League West, and would do so again in 1986, but lost the American League Championship Series both times. On September 17, 1984, on the 17th anniversary of the day he hit his first home run, he hit his 500th, at Anaheim Stadium off Bud Black of the Royals. In 1987, he signed a one-year contract to return to the A's, wearing the number 44 with which he was now most associated rather than the number 9 he previously wore in Oakland. He announced he would retire after the season, at the age of 41. In his last at-bat, at Comiskey Park in Chicago on October 4, he collected a broken-bat single up the middle, but the A's lost to the White Sox, 5–2. Jackson was the last player in the major leagues to have played for the Kansas City Athletics. Jackson played 21 seasons and reached the post-season in 11 of them, winning six pennants and five World Series. His accomplishments include winning both the regular-season and World Series MVP awards in 1973, hitting 563 career home runs (sixth all-time at the time of his retirement), maintaining a .490 career slugging percentage, being named to 14 All-Star teams, and the dubious distinction of being the all-time leader in strikeouts with 2,597 (he finished with 13 more career strikeouts than hits) and second on the all-time list for most Golden sombreros (at least four strikeouts in a game) with 23 – he led this statistic until 2014, when he was surpassed by Ryan Howard. Jackson was the first major leaguer to hit 100 home runs for three different clubs, having hit over 100 for the Athletics, Yankees, and Angels. He is the only player in the 500 home run club that never had consecutive 30 home run seasons in a career. During his freshman year at Arizona State, he met Jennie Campos, a Mexican-American. Jackson asked Campos on a date, and discovered many similarities, including the ability to speak Spanish, and being raised in a single parent home (Campos' father was killed in the Korean War). An assistant football coach tried to break up the couple because Jackson was black and Campos was considered white. The coach contacted Campos' uncle, a wealthy benefactor of the school, and he warned the couple that their being together was a bad idea. But the relationship held up and she later became his wife. Jackson has been divorced since 1973. Kimberly, his only child, was born in the late 1980s. During the off-season, though still active in baseball, Jackson worked as a field reporter and color commentator for ABC Sports. Just over a month before signing with the Yankees in the fall of 1976, Jackson did analysis in the ABC booth with Keith Jackson and Howard Cosell the night his future team won the American League pennant on a homer by Chris Chambliss. During the 1980s (1983, 1985, and 1987 respectively), Jackson was given the task of presiding over the World Series Trophy presentations. In addition, Jackson did color commentary for the 1984 National League Championship Series (alongside Don Drysdale and Earl Weaver). After his retirement as an active player, Jackson returned to his color commentary role covering the 1988 American League Championship Series (alongside Gary Bender and Joe Morgan) for ABC. Jackson appeared in the film The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!, portraying an Angels outfielder hypnotically programmed to kill the Queen of England. He also appeared in Richie Rich, BASEketball, Summer of Sam and The Benchwarmers. In 1979, Jackson was a guest star in an episode of the television sitcom Diff'rent Strokes and also in an episode of The Love Boat. He played himself in the Archie Bunker's Place episode ""Reggie-3 Archie-0"" in 1982, a 1990 MacGyver episode, ""Squeeze Play"", The Jeffersons episode ""The Unnatural” from 1985, and the Malcolm in the Middle episode ""Polly in the Middle"", from 2004. Jackson was also considered for the role of Geordi La Forge in the series Star Trek: The Next Generation, a role that ultimately went to LeVar Burton. From 1981 to 1982 he hosted for Nickelodeon's Reggie Jackson's World of Sports. He co-authored a book in 2010, Sixty-Feet Six-Inches, with fellow Hall of Famer Bob Gibson. The book, whose title refers to the distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate, details their careers and approach to the game. The Sega Master System baseball video game Reggie Jackson Baseball, endorsed by Jackson, was sold exclusively in the United States. Outside of the U.S., it was released as American Baseball. Jackson was the de facto spokesperson for the Upper Deck Company during the early 1990s, appearing in numerous advertisements, appearances, and participating in the company's Heroes of Baseball exhibition games. This affiliation also included Jackson being included the ""Find the Reggie"" promotion which inserted 2500 autograph cards into packs of 1990 Upper Deck Baseball High Series packs. This inclusion of an autograph card marked an important first in what would become a very popular trend in the trading card hobby. Jackson has endured three fires to personal property, including a 1991 fire to his home in Oakland that destroyed his 1973 MVP Award. One of his warehouses holding several of his collectible cars was damaged in a fire, with several of the cars, valued at $3.2 million, ruined. Jackson called on former San Francisco 49ers head coach and ordained minister Mike Singletary for spiritual guidance. Jackson credits Singletary, stating ""he helped me drop that shell I put up."" Jackson and Steinbrenner would reconcile, and Steinbrenner would hire him as a ""special assistant to the principal owner"", making Jackson a consultant and a liaison to the team's players, particularly the minority players. By this point, the Yankees, long noted for being slow to adapt to changes in race relations, have come to develop many minority players in their farm system and seek out others via trades and free agency. Jackson usually appears in uniform at the Yankee's spring training complex in Tampa, Florida, and was sought out for advice by such recent stars as Derek Jeter, before his retirement, and by former Yankee star Alex Rodriguez. ""His experience is vast, and he's especially good with the young players in our minor league system, the 17- and 18-year old kids. They respect him and what he's accomplished in his career. When Reggie Jackson tells a young kid how he might improve his swing, he tends to listen"", said Hal Steinbrenner, Yankees' managing general partner and co-chairperson. Jackson was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1993. He chose to wear a Yankees cap on his Hall of Fame plaque after the Oakland Athletics unceremoniously fired him from a coaching position in 1991. The Yankees retired his uniform number 44 on August 14, 1993, shortly after his induction into the Hall of Fame. The Athletics retired his number 9 on May 22, 2004. He is one of only eight MLB players to have their numbers retired by more than one team, and one of only three to have different numbers retired by two MLB teams. In 1999, Jackson placed 48th on Sporting News 100 Greatest Baseball Players. That same year, he was named one of 100 finalists for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, but was not one of the 30 players chosen by the fans. The Yankees dedicated a plaque in his honor on July 6, 2002, which now hangs in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. The plaque calls him ""One of the most colorful and exciting players of his era"" and ""a prolific hitter who thrived in pressure situations."" Each Yankee so honored and still living was on hand for the dedication: Phil Rizzuto, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford and Don Mattingly. Ron Guidry, a teammate of Jackson's for all five of his seasons with the Yankees, was there, and would be honored with a Monument Park plaque the next season. Out of respect to some of the players who Jackson admired while growing up, Jackson invited Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Ernie Banks to attend the ceremony, and each did so. Like Jackson, each was a member of the Hall of Fame and had hit over 500 career home runs. Each had also played in the Negro Leagues, as Jackson's father, Martinez Jackson, had. Jackson expanded his love of antique cars into a chain of auto dealerships in California, and used his contacts to become one of the foremost traders of sports memorabilia. He has also been the public face of a group attempting to purchase a major league team, already having made unsuccessful attempts to buy the Athletics and the Angels. His attempt to acquire the Angels along with Jimmy Nederlander (minority owner of the New York Yankees), Jackie Autry (widow of former Angels owner Gene Autry) and other luminaries was thwarted by Mexican American billionaire Arturo Moreno who outbid Jackson's group by nearly $50 million for the team in the winter of 2002. In a July 2012 edition of Sports Illustrated, Jackson talked about several issues, and also was critical of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as he believes they have lowered their standards when voting for prospects in the Hall of Fame. He has also been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating ""I believe that Hank Aaron is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was."" Of Alex Rodriguez, whom Jackson has worked alongside as special assistant to the Yankees, Jackson remarked, ""Al's a very good friend. But I think there are real questions about his numbers. As much as I like him, what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers."" On July 12, the Yankees released a statement from Jackson after the Sports Illustrated interview had been released. The press release included Jackson saying, ""In trying to convey my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate about, I made the mistake of naming some specific players."" It had been reported  he had been told by the Yankees to steer clear from the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated he had not been banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and would later be free to interact with the club. After the SI article became known and Jackson's status with the Yankees being talked about, Jackson confirmed in his statement ""I continue to have a strong relationship with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team."" In 2007, ESPN aired a mini-series called The Bronx is Burning, about the 1977 Yankees, with the conflicts and controversies around Jackson a central part of the storyline. The series infuriated Jackson as he is portrayed as selfish and arrogant. Jackson is portrayed by Daniel Sunjata. In 2008, he threw out the first pitch at Yankees Opening Day, the last one at Yankee Stadium. He also threw out the first pitch at the first game at the new Yankee Stadium (an exhibition game). On October 9, 2009, Jackson threw the opening pitch for Game 2 of the ALDS between the New York Yankees and the Minnesota Twins. On October 18, 2010, the Ride of Fame honored Jackson with a double decker tour bus in New York City. On September 5, 2018, before an Athletics game versus the Yankees in Oakland, Jackson was inducted into the inaugural Oakland Athletics Hall of Fame. He joined fellow inductees Rickey Henderson, Dave Stewart, Dennis Eckersley, Catfish Hunter and Rollie Fingers.",26365,2046,2019-20,14.0,10.0,381.0,7.2,18.7,0.384,2.9,7.7,0.378,4.3,11.0,0.388,2.5,3.1,0.788,1.0,2.8,3.9,6.8,0.8,0.1,2.2,2.0,19.7,9.0,Detroit Pistons

He played college basketball for the Wyoming Cowboys.He was selected by the Sacramento Kings in the second round of the 2019 NBA draft.A native of Port St. Lucie, Florida, James was an unheralded basketball recruit out of high school, generating only one high-major offer from Mississippi State, before ultimately going to the University of Wyoming.He became a full-time contributor by his sophomore year and increased his scoring average each year.James led the Mountain West Conference in scoring during his final season at Wyoming, averaging 22.1 points per game as a senior,despite playing as a point guard, a position he does not normally play, because Wyoming needed James to have the ball as much as possible during a 8–24 season.He also led the Cowboys with 8.5 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game,and made second team All-Mountain West. James had a three-point field goal percentage of 33.7 percent during his college career.Despite his high scoring, James posted career-lows in field goal percentage (40.9 percent) and 3-point field goal percentage (29.6 percent) during his senior high, as well as 4.1 turnovers per game.James finished his college career with 2,061 points, the third-highest in Mountain West history.He also participated in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, one of 64 seniors from around the country invited to the event.James was selected by the Sacramento Kings in the second round of the 2019 NBA draft with the No. 40 overall pick,and is the first University of Wyoming player drafted since the Los Angeles Lakers selected Larry Nance Jr. in 2015.He was the Kings' first pick in the draft, as the team did not have a first-round selection.CBS Sports had ranked James as the 96th-best prospect heading into the draft, while The Sporting News and nbadraft.net had him unranked, and most mock drafts did not predict he would be picked.But Sacramento General Manager Vlade Divac said the team drafted him because they followed his college career and appreciated his passion and production: ""We talked to everybody about his professionalism and his love for the game. We were so excited when we spent time with him in Sacramento.""On July 10, 2019, the Sacramento Kings announced that they had signed James. On October 25, 2019, James made his debut in NBA, coming off from bench in a 112–122 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers with two points.

He is often regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.His accomplishments include three NBA championships, four NBA MVP Awards, three NBA Finals MVP Awards, and two Olympic gold medals. Lebron's teams appeared in eight consecutive NBA Finals (2011-2018 seasons). Lebron leads with the record for all-time NBA playoffs points scored, is third in all-time NBA points scored, and eighth in all-time NBA assists. James was selected to the All-NBA First Team a record twelve times, made the All-Defensive First Team five times, played in sixteen NBA All-Star Games as All-Star MVP three times. James played basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, where he was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003 as the first overall draft pick. Named the 2003–04 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players; he won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 to sign as a free agent with the Miami Heat. This move was announced in an ESPN special titled The Decision, and is one of the most controversial free agent decisions in American sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned league MVP and Finals MVP. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals coming back down 3–1, delivering the franchise's first championship and ending Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought. In 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers to sign with the Lakers. Off the court, James has accumulated additional wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America's most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials. He has also hosted the ESPY Awards and Saturday Night Live, and appeared in the 2015 film Trainwreck. James was born on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of his birth.:22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.:23 James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.:24 The group dubbed themselves the ""Fab Four"" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.:27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.As a freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent-St. Mary varsity basketball team.The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated. As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.Before the start of his junior year, James was featured in Slam, an American basketball magazine, and writer Ryan Jones lauded him as possibly ""the best high school basketball player in America right now"". During the season, he also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.:104 With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.:117 St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.:114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft. During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving. Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.:142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season.:143 For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,:178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft. Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA superstar. This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points. St. Vincent-St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years. As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent-St. Mary's football team.:51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame. At the conclusion of his sophomore year, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. He did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game. Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, former and current players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League. James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance. At the conclusion of the season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and with final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, he also became just the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie. Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year. James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection in 2004–05, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference. Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, with Denver Nuggets coach George Karl telling Sports Illustrated, ""It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule."" On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record. With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team. Despite a 30–20 record to start the year, the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40. At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game, he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash. Under James's leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998. In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards. In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in Game 5. Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round. In 2006–07, James's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus. The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed. In Game 5 of the NBA Conference Finals, James notched 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, against the Pistons. After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance ""one of the greatest moments in postseason history"" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as ""Jordan-esque"". In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history. The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals. During the championship round, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting, and Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep. In February of the 2007–08 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance. On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty. His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title. Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37. Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round. During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a ""shootout"". At the conclusion of the 2008–09 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history. With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award. Reflecting on James's performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote, ""He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it."" In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1. Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game. In February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt. Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season. Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award. To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round. James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd. The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and nine turnovers in the losing effort. James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season. Upon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James's choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show. Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James's actions. Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey. Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as ""the man"". James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision. As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which was a radical change from prior years. The phrase ""taking my talents to South Beach"" became a punch line for critics. In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision. James officially signed with the Heat on July 10, 2010. With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982. That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new ""big three"" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere. During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships. Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James. Throughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains. To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games. James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past. On December 2, James faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent. He scored 38 points and led Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball. The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting. In the conference semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Celtics for the second consecutive year. In Game 5, he scored Miami's last ten points to help seal a series-clinching win. After the final buzzer, he famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team. The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they were defeated by the Dallas Mavericks in six games. James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series. His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history. James was humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, and the experience inspired him to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped him regain a sense of joy on the court. He also decided that his post game needed improvement, so he worked with Hakeem Olajuwon during the off-season. Behind James's significantly-expanded skillset, Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record. He was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting. In the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Chris Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1. James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and 9-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series. To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a ""career-defining performance"". Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James's budding rival, Kevin Durant. Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps. In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James's first championship. James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. His full postseason run, in which he averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN. In February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records. That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history. Based on these accomplishments, James's performance was described as a ""month for the ages"" by Sports Illustrated. Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record, and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously. His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting. In Game 1 of the Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers. Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his ""Cleveland days"". Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the Spurs, signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier. At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3. In Game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory. In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points. He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round. On March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting. In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets. In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so. In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead. In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate. San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat. For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game. On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent. On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers. In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received. On July 12, he officially signed with the team, who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure. A month after James's signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving. In January of the 2014–15 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career. In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls. In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals. For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities. Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games. Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round. During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East. James's final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including ""The Block"" on Andre Iguodala, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection. The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers; James later described it as one of the ""strangest"" years of his career. Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too ""top heavy"", for which he received countercriticism. The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game. In Game 3 of the first round of the postseason, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history. In Game 5 of the Conference Finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader. The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to their third consecutive Finals against the Warriors, who had signed James's rival Kevin Durant during the off-season. Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games. Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James. After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December. Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record. In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort. Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; for example, on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits. James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a career-high 9.2 assists and 4.2 turnovers per game. In the playoffs, he guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Warriors. Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors. In the first game of the Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland was defeated in overtime. Following the defeat, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series. The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists per game for the Finals. On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent. On July 1, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers; the deal was officially completed on July 9. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent, Rich Paul, explained, ""In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do."" Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination. Following James's signing, the Lakers rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. As a result, to begin the 2018–19 season, the team struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games. In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers, and four days later he scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Heat. After blowing out the Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury in the process. He ultimately missed a career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him. The team was unable to recover and failed to qualify for the postseason, marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005 and the first time he failed to reach the Finals since 2010. On March 7, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction, and on March 30, he was officially ruled out for the remainder of the season. James's final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, and despite his inconsistent campaign, he was ultimately named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in 12 years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team. On January 25, 2020, he passed Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time scoring list, the day before Bryant’s death in a helicopter crash. James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. He spent the Games mostly on the bench, averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games. Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup. James felt his limited playing time was a ""lowlight"" and believed he was not given ""a fair opportunity to play"". His attitude during the Olympics was described as ""disrespectful"" and ""distasteful"" by columnists Adrian Wojnarowski and Peter Vecsey, respectively. At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain. The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal. James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members. Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice. At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier. Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: ""I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now."" At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000. In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain. James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England. He became the leader of the team with Kobe Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.[b] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history. He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year. Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James ""is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now."" Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), James has started at point guard , shooting guard , small forward, and power forward, but he can also play the other position. His athletic and versatile playing style has drawn comparisons to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. As of June 2019, James's career averages are 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.6 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game. Since 2011, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN and Sports Illustrated. As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring. He holds numerous ""youngest to"" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points. During his first stint in Cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented, he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball. His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones. These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets. Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game. Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games. In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James's role to a more unconventional one. James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots. He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's ""pass-happy"" offense. Behind these improvements, James's overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels. During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as ""average"". Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016. His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint. Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds. For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team. His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history. By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses, James creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists. He executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters. Early in James's career, he was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations; specifically, for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games. However, as his career progressed, James's clutch performance was viewed more favorably. At the beginning of James's NBA career, he was considered a poor defensive player, but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, he became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block their shot. In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions. Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme, with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position. Beginning in 2014, some analysts noted a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines. During his second stint in Cleveland, his defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball; and he was less aggressive in switching. James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as ""chill mode"". He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as ""Playoff LeBron"". James left high school as one of the most hyped NBA prospects of all-time.[c] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season. As of June 2019, he has been named to 15 All-NBA Teams, which is tied for the most in league history, and 12 All-NBA first teams, which is an NBA record. His four MVP awards are matched only by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span. James has also won three Finals MVP Awards, which is tied for the second-most all-time, and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. His teams have appeared in the Finals nine times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition. James is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players ever. In February 2016, he was ranked fifth by Sports Illustrated; in March 2016, he was ranked third by ESPN; in February 2017, he was ranked second by CBS Sports; in December 2017, he was ranked second by Fox Sports; and in February 2018, he was ranked second by Slam Magazine. He is often mentioned as the greatest player of all-time, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan. In February 2018, Bill Simmons' website, The Ringer, spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead. Coaches and players have also debated James's status, such as Steve Kerr, who posited that James and Jordan are the two best players in history. Brian Windhorst, who spent his career covering James, said, ""No one has ever had as much hype as James has had to live up to, and James has delivered on every last drop."" On December 29, 2019, The Associated Press named James as its Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s. James has three children with Savannah Brinson, his high school sweetheart: Bronny (b. 2004), Bryce (b. 2007), and Zhuri (b. 2014). James proposed to Brinson at a December 31, 2011, party celebrating New Year's Eve and his 27th birthday, and the two were married on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California. During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay. In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million. By 2015, James was considered by many people, including his fellow NBA players, to be the ""face of the NBA"". His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014 he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season. On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). Throughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes, and in 2017, he was listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters. Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games versus the New York Yankees. Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision, he was listed as one of most disliked athletes in the US. By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career. In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll. He has led the league in jersey sales six times. In March 2008, James became the first black man—and third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney—to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen. In response, noted ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and ""memorable for the wrong reasons"", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, James has found himself in public controversy over a statement he made about a now-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey, in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. James said Morey was “misinformed”. James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012. James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized. Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility; for example, in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season. This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat. During his second stint in Cleveland, he began opting out and re-signing on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap. In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal, becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career. James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are Audemars Piguet, Coca-Cola, Dunkin' Brands, McDonald's, Nike, State Farm and Beats by Dre. Coming out of high school, he was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas, eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million. His signature shoes have performed well for Nike. In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool, who he has claimed his support for. As a result of James's endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes. In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million. In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones. In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson, and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi). James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity. In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida. James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards. In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live. He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage. In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck, receiving positive reviews for his performance. That same year, James's digital video company, Uninterrupted, raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman. James and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment, whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James's high school years. Series produced by SpringHill include NBC game show The Wall, the Disney XD sports documentaries Becoming, Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse, and animated web series The LeBrons. In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland. In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince. In February 2018 it was announced that James's production company will produce a new film in the House Party series with James expected to make a cameo. Later that month, Fox News journalist Laura Ingraham told James to ""Shut up and dribble"" as a response to his political agendas. This largely contributed to James creating a documentary series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, Shut Up and Dribble on Showtime. During the 2019 off-season, James filed for a trademark (through a shell company) on the term ""Taco Tuesday"" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services. This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was ""a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment."" As of September 2019, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram. In February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album, Rap or Go to the League. A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is ""celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship."" The press release also says the title ""challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player"". James is an active supporter of non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund. He also has his own charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation, which is based in Akron. Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes. In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021. In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali. In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his ""outstanding service and dedication to the community."" In November of that same year, the Akron School Board approved the ""I Promise School"", a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LeBron James Family Foundation to help struggling elementary school students stay in school. James later reflected that it was his most important professional accomplishment of his life. The school officially opened on July 30, 2018. Throughout his career, James has taken stances on controversial issues. On several occasions, he mentioned a feeling of obligation to affect change using his status. Those include the War in Darfur, the Trayvon Martin case, the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014, the Michael Brown verdict, and the death of Eric Garner. Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed, ""being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America."" Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the ""Make America Great Again"" slogan and said, ""It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh?"" He then said that ""Our youth deserve better!!"" James also called Trump a ""bum"" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry. During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James accused Trump for attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that ""sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together."" He declared he would ""never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Barack though."" In response, Trump tweeted, ""LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do."" James has supported Colin Kaepernick in the aftermath of his participation in the national anthem protests, claiming that he was being ""blackballed"" from a new contract in the National Football League, and that he would hire him if he owned a football team. He has worn his clothing in a show of support several times. In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee to elect Barack Obama as president. Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement. The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert. In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential election.",26367,2065,2019-20,51.0,51.0,1779.0,9.9,20.2,0.489,2.2,6.4,0.345,7.7,13.8,0.556,3.8,5.6,0.687,1.0,7.0,8.1,11.2,1.3,0.4,4.2,1.8,25.8,14.0,Los Angeles Lakers

He played college basketball for the Virginia Cavaliers. Jerome attended Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, New York and was a four-year varsity player. After his junior season at Iona Prep, he was named first-team All-Conference, All-Metropolitan, and All-State.Jerome's senior season was cut short due to a hip injury.On September 2, 2014, Jerome committed to playing college basketball at the University of Virginia.During his freshman year at Virginia, Jerome was the backup point guard to London Perrantes. Coming off the bench, he averaged 4.3 points, 1.6 rebounds, and 1.5 assists. Jerome took over as the Cavaliers' starting point guard his sophomore year. On December 30, 2017, he put up a career-high 31 points against Boston College. His play during the season earned him a spot on the All-ACC Third Team. Prior to the 2018-2019 season, Jerome was selected to the pre-season all-ACC Second Team.On February 4, 2019, Jerome was named as one of the ten finalists for the Bob Cousy Award, recognizing the nation's top college point guard. He was projected in most mock drafts as an early second-round pick in the 2019 NBA draft.Jerome averaged 13.6 points per game and 5.5 assists per game, helping lead Virginia to another #1 seed in the 2019 NCAA Tournament. Virginia would win the 2019 Championship game 85-77 behind Jerome's 16 points, 8 assists, and 6 rebounds. At the conclusion of the season, Jerome announced his intention to forgo his final season of collegiate eligibility and declare for the 2019 NBA Draft while hiring an agent.On June 20, 2019, the Philadelphia 76ers selected Jerome with the 24th pick in the 2019 NBA draft. His rights were later traded to the Boston Celtics alongside Philadelphia's 33rd pick for the draft rights to Matisse Thybullebefore being traded to the Phoenix Suns alongside Aron Baynes for a future first round pick.Coincidentally, both players the Suns traded for were recruited out of high school and played their college basketball for Tony Bennett: Baynes at Washington State and Jerome at Virginia. On July 6, 2019, the Phoenix Suns announced that they had signed Jerome. Before the start of the season, Jerome sprained his right ankle on October 21, leaving him out indefinitely. On November 25, Jerome was assigned to the Northern Arizona Suns. Jerome played the next day in a loss against the Iowa Wolves before being recalled by Phoenix on November 27.

Jones recorded four double-doubles during the season, including a career-high 26 points to go with 10 rebounds against Chaminade at the Maui Invitational Tournament.On February 29, 2016, UNLV was notified by the ACT testing service that Jones' score had been cancelled. As a result, Jones was deemed ineligible to compete under NCAA rules and was forced to sit out the remaining three games of UNLV's season.On April 7, 2016, Jones declared for the 2016 NBA draft, but left open the possibility of returning to UNLV or going to another college program by not hiring an agent.Later that month, Jones hired an agent and remained in the draft.Jones ultimately went undrafted in the 2016 draft, and subsequently joined the Sacramento Kings for the 2016 NBA Summer League.However, due to a groin injury, he was unable to play for the Kings during the tournament. On September 25, 2016, Jones signed with the Phoenix Suns for training camp.Jones secured an opening-night roster spot after impressing the Suns during training camp and preseason. He made his NBA debut in his home state against the Philadelphia 76ers on November 19, 2016, and recorded his first field goal in the NBA to finish with three points in three minutes against the San Antonio Spurs on December 15, 2016.

He went on to make it through to the final round of the Slam Dunk Contest, where he ultimately lost to Glenn Robinson III. Through the All-Star break, Jones appeared in only seven of the Suns first 57 games, never played more than 5:07, and never scored more than six points—which he tallied in the Suns last game right before the All-Star break as an opportunity to get a dunk in the NBA stat books prior to appearing in the Dunk contest days later.

He previously played for the Minnesota Timberwolves from 2015-2019. He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils in his freshman season as part of the 2014–15 National Championship team. He was ranked among the top 10 players in the national high school class of 2014 by Rivals.com, Scout.com and ESPN.He was a Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) Class 4A state champion, three-time Minnesota Associated Press Boys Basketball Player of the Year and three-time Minnesota Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year for Apple Valley High School. He played in the 2014 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, 2014 Jordan Brand Classic and the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit. He won the skills competition at the 2014 McDonald's All-American Game and posted the only double-double in the 2014 Jordan Brand Classic. He committed to the Duke University men's basketball team as a package with Jahlil Okafor. He was a 2014 USA Today second team All-USA Boys Basketball Team selection. At Duke, he was an All-ACC third team and All-ACC Freshman first team selection. He earned NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player during Duke's victory in the championship game of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Subsequently, he announced he would enter the 2015 NBA draft. He was selected with the 24th overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers and traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves. With Minnesota he went on to set the NBA single-season assist to turnover ratio record. Jones earned the role as a varsity starter for Apple Valley as an eighth grader for the 2009–10 season.That year, he averaged 16.8 points per game and 8.1 assists per game, starting every game for a team that went 20–8.That season he received his first recruiting letter (at age 13) from USC.As a freshman, he received his first scholarship offer from Iowa.That season, he averaged 20.1 points, 7.1 assists and 2.6 steals per game in 16 games, after missing 7 weeks due to a lacerated kidney.Following his freshman season, he was invited to attend separate skills camps hosted by LeBron James and Chris Paul.However, he was also invited by USA Basketball to the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado to be one of 27 athletes try out for the 12-man FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship team, which he eventually was selected to.Team USA won the tournament. By the time he attended the July 2011 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Peach Jam tournament he already had offers from Minnesota and Baylor. In the days after the four-day tournament that was attended by leading coaches such as Thad Matta, Tom Izzo, Jim Boeheim, Roy Williams, John Calipari, Josh Pastner, Bill Self, Sean Miller and Rick Pitino, he received offers from Ohio State, Michigan State, Marquette, Providence, Arizona and Iowa State. As a sophomore, he was a unanimous selection as the 2012 Minnesota Associated Press Player of the Year for high school boys basketball and was named to the 2012 Associated Press All-state team along with Siyani Chambers, Joey King, Tyler Vaughan and Johnny Woodard.Jones' Apple Valley team was eliminated in the MSHSL Class 4A, Section 3 final by Eastview High School.Jones averaged 28 points and 8 assists in 31 minutes per game. He earned the 2012 Minnesota Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year. He was the 2012 Star Tribune Metro Player of the Year in boys' basketball as well as the Pioneer Press' boys basketball player of the year. By the end of his sophomore season, he had an offer from Duke to go along with his earlier offers from Minnesota, Iowa State, Michigan State, Ohio State, Providence, Arizona, Baylor and Marquette.Following the season, Jones again played for Team USA at the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship in Kaunas, Lithuania from June 29 – July 8, 2012. The team went undefeated in 8 games. Jones entered his 2012–13 junior season as the national class of 2014's top ranked basketball player according to ESPN. Sports Illustrated columnist Frank Burlison listed him second to Jahlil Okafor on August 16, 2012. On September 11, when Okafor was named a monthly blogger for USA Today High School Sports, he noted that he and Jones wanted to attend a Michigan State Spartans football game together. Jones was one of 10 USA Today preseason All-USA selections (along with Aaron Gordon, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, Kasey Hill, Okafor, Parker, Julius Randle, Noah Vonleh, Andrew Wiggins). At the January 5, 2013, Timberwolves Shootout at the Target Center, Jones led Apple Valley on a 31–9 run to overcome an 11-point deficit with 9 minutes and 19 seconds remaining against Rashad Vaughn and Robbinsdale Cooper High School. The head-to-head matchup of class of 2014 guards Jones and Vaughn was described as ""arguably the best individual-to-individual matchup in Minnesota high school basketball history"" by the Star Tribune. Two weeks before the matchup of ESPN 100 top 10 high school players, NBA.com had anticipated the matchup with a feature story. Following his junior season, he was co-winner of the Minnesota Associated Press Player of the Year award for high school boys basketball, with DeLaSalle fellow junior Reid Travis. Jones led Apple Valley to the MSHSL Class 4A championship, while Travis led DeLaSalle to the 3A championship. They were joined on the Associated Press All-State team by Anders Broman, Rashad Vaughn and Graham Woodward. Jones earned the 2013 Minnesota Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year and the Pioneer Press player of the year. However, Travis was the 2013 Star Tribune Metro Player of the Year in boys' basketball. Following the season, Jones was selected by HighSchoolHardwood.com as one of two juniors (along with Okafor) on its first or second five selections of its 2012-13 High School Hardwood All-American teams. Stanley Johnson was the only other junior on the 20-man All-American First Team. On March 9 Jones listed his final seven schools: Baylor, Duke, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan State, Minnesota and Ohio State. Jones had unofficially visited all seven of these schools before his junior season ended. In late April 2013, Okafor's father believed it was very possible that Okafor and Jones would matriculate together as a package. By late April, there were rumors that Cliff Alexander and Justise Winslow would attend whatever school Jones and Okafor attended. On May 30, Okafor cut his list of schools to eight: Arizona, Baylor, Duke, Illinois, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan State and Ohio State, which overlapped with Jones in six schools. Although Alexander was ranked as the fifth best player in the class of 2014 by Rivals.com and had offers from four of the six schools common to both by the beginning of June, he said the chances of him matriculating with Jones and Okafor was slim. As the summer evaluation period continued, the unique nature of the possibility of Okafor and Jones, who are not related and not teammates, going to college as a package continued to get a lot of press. Jones was co-MVP for the 2013 Under Armour Elite 24 All-star game's winning team. On August 13, Jones announced that he would take official visits to four schools Baylor August 30 – September 1; Kentucky September 27–29; Kansas October 18–20; and Duke October 25–27. Notably, Duke, which is the favorite according to Star Tribune writer Amelia Rayno, is scheduled last. On August 14, Jones confirmed that he might make a fifth official visit (the maximum allowed by the NCAA) to Minnesota, although they remained an unlikely underdog. Okafor visited Baylor on August 29 with Jones as the two were ranked 1–2 in the Rivals.com class of 2014 rankings. One of the reasons Baylor was a serious contender is that Jared Nuness, a member of the Baylor basketball staff, is Jones' cousin. On September 4, 2013, Rivals.com updated their ranking with Jones slipping from 2nd to 5th (behind Emmanuel Mudiay, Johnson and Alexander) and the top point guard position to second (behind Mudiay). Rivals clarified that Okafor and Jones, who are considered a package deal, had visited Baylor together and would visit both Kansas and Duke together, but that they would visit Kentucky separately. On September 13, class of 2014 point guard Tyler Ulis committed to Kentucky. Subsequently, Jones canceled his September 27–29 visit to Kentucky. As Okafor and Jones visited Kansas and Duke together during the last two weekends of October, those two schools were considered the favorites for the services of both. At Kansas, head coach Bill Self scheduled a second open practice for the weekend of the Okafor/Jones visit. ESPN.com's number 14 overall prospect Winslow attended Duke for an official visit the same weekend that Okafor and Jones did. At the beginning of October, rumors began that Jones and Okafor would meet in a nationally televised game on December 12 that could be the first regular season high school basketball game ever broadcast on ESPN from Minnesota.

Prior to his senior season, USA Today named him to its 10-man preseason All-USA team along with Alexander, Stanley Johnson, Trey Lyles, Mudiay, Malik Newman, Okafor, Kelly Oubre, D'Angelo Russell, and Myles Turner.

He was a 2014 USA Today second team All-USA Boys Basketball Team selection and a second team All-American according to MaxPreps. By the summer after his 2010–11 freshman season, he was described as the best point guard from the state of Minnesota since Khalid El-Amin.Another Minnesotan who is a measuring stick for Jones is Sam Jacobson. According to Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller, when he plays for Duke, Jones is likely to finish among the top 5 in the nation in assists per game but may need to work on his defense. As he entered his freshman season at Duke, he was expected to battle with senior point guard Quinn Cook and junior guard Rasheed Sulaimon for playing time following the graduation of Tyler Thornton. Well before the season there were expectations that Jones would win the starting point guard position. Thus, he was selected by USA Today to its Preseason All-American second team and by CBS Sports to its Preseason All-American third team.

In 2015, the mayor of his hometown in Apple Valley pronounced April 22 as ""Tyus Jones Day"". On April 15, 2015, Jones announced he was ending his college career to enter the 2015 NBA draft. He was selected with the 24th overall pick in the draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, who then traded his draft rights to his hometown team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, in exchange for a 2019 second round draft pick and the draft rights to the 31st and 36th picks in the draft, Cedi Osman and Rakeem Christmas, respectively. On July 7, 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Timberwolves. Jones started in the preseason opener when Ricky Rubio was sidelined, but did not fare well against Russell Westbrook, going scoreless and nearly giving up a triple double. Jones began the season fourth on the Timberwolves depth chart at point guard (behind Rubio, Zach LaVine and Andre Miller) and was inactive for the October 28 season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers. Jones was active for the first time on November 7 when Kevin Martin had to be away from the team for the game against the Chicago Bulls. Two games later on November 10, he was active again when three starters were sidelined, including Rubio who was scratched from the lineup right before tipoff. He made his debut that night against the Charlotte Hornets, posting his first assist, steal, rebound and point. On December 5, using the flexible assignment rule, the Timberwolves assigned Jones to the Idaho Stampede, the D-League affiliate of the Utah Jazz. On December 22, he was recalled by the Timberwolves after he averaged 24.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.5 steals in 35.2 minutes per game in six starts in the D-League. He made his first NBA field goals on December 23 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring 6 points in 20 minutes. Jones didn't play in 17 consecutive games (since January 4) and then had a season-high 5 assists on February 8 against the New Orleans Pelicans. By late February, head coach Sam Mitchell noted that Jones would be getting sufficient playing time to be evaluated. On February 22 he posted a career-high 9 points on 4-of-7 shooting against the Boston Celtics. On February 28, he posted 6 assists against the Dallas Mavericks. Jones posted 6 assists and 10 points against the San Antonio Spurs on March 8. On April 7, Jones tallied 4 steals against the Sacramento Kings. On April 13, he closed out the season with a 12-assist effort against the New Orleans Pelicans. During the 2016 NBA Summer League, Jones was named MVP of the league. He led Minnesota to four consecutive wins during the tournament to advance to the NBA Summer League's Championship game after losing the opening three games in Las Vegas. In seven games in Las Vegas, Jones averaged 19.4 points on 45.7 percent shooting to go with 6.3 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Nonetheless he began the season behind Rubio and Kris Dunn on the team depth chart. He made his season debut on November 1 with 6 assists in the Timberwolves' third game against Memphis when Rubio was lost indefinitely to a sprained elbow. On November 8, Jones posted career highs with 12 points and 5 steals as well as a career-high tying 5 rebounds to go along with a game-high 7 assists against the Brooklyn Nets. When Rubio did not play in the April 12, 2017 regular season finale against the Houston Rockets, Timberwolves point guards Kris Dunn and Jones both set new career highs with 16 assists and 17 points, respectively. Over the course of the year Jones averaged 4.2 points and 2.9 assists playing sporadically at first and then in the final 26 games. Following the 2017 NBA draft, the Timberwolves traded Dunn and LaVine away to acquire Jimmy Butler. A week later, the team traded away Rubio for a 2018 NBA draft first round selection. Thus, the 2017–18 Minnesota Timberwolves entered training camp with just Jones and Jeff Teague at point guard. Jones' ability to contribute was a bit of a question mark according to some. He had been perceived as slow and small previously and his defensive statistics bore that out. However, in his third year he became an above average defender statistically. When Teague was sidelined for the last four games in November, Jones averaged 11.3 points, 6.5 assists and four steals per game over 38.5 minutes. In the second of those four games, Jones posted a career-high seven steals and a career-high tying two blocked shots in his first career NBA start against the Phoenix Suns on November 26, 2017. On December 17, 2018, Jones posted a 10-point/10-assist double double (the first of his NBA career) against the Sacramento Kings. Jones closed out the year on December 31 with a career-high 13-assist performance and season-high 15 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. At that point in the season, Jones was leading the NBA by a wide margin in several statistical ratios: Assist-to-turnover (6.8), steal-to-turnover (2.4) and steal-to-foul (1.4), with the former two being NBA record paces. On April 7, Jones tied his career high with 13 assists without committing a turnover against the Oklahoma City Thunder. On April 9, Jones had his streak of 129:18 without a turnover stopped by the Toronto Raptors. Nonetheless, Jones ended the season with an NBA-record-setting 6.96 (min 200 assists) single-season assist to turnover ratio. On July 11, 2019, Jones signed with the Memphis Grizzlies after the Timberwolves refused to match their offer sheet. Jones helped USA Basketball win gold at both the 2011 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship and 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship. Jones' 28 assists over 5 games led the U16 team. The U17 team went undefeated in 8 games as Jones led the team with 43 assists. On May 5, 2014, USA Basketball announced the 21 athletes (including Jones) invited to tryout from June 10 to 19 for the 12-member USA national team for the June 20–24, 2014 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship. Jones was one of 10 incoming freshman to be selected. Eventually, 24 players tried out for the team and the roster was cut to 15 on June 12. In the end, Jones made the final 12 man roster that was announced on June 15. The United States claimed a gold medal in the tournament as Jones served as captain.

His younger brother, Avery Jordan, is a professional football player who currently plays for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. Jordan is a strong rebounder, averaging 10.1 rebounds per game in his career and leading the league in two seasons. He is also an excellent post-defender who averages 1.8 blocks per game for his career. Jordan's defensive play has even been compared to the defensive play of Bill Russell, a Hall of Fame center who is considered by many to be one of the greatest defenders and players of all time. On offense, he heavily relies on put-backs and alley-oops to score. He has led the league in field goal percentage in five seasons. However, he is a poor free throw shooter, making just 46% of his shots at the line, leading to opponents exploiting this weakness by intentionally fouling him with the Hack-a-Shaq strategy. Jordan is considered one of the more durable players in the NBA, having played in 360 straight games at one point.",26384,2235,2019-20,46.0,4.0,995.0,5.6,8.5,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.6,8.5,0.66,2.5,3.5,0.701,4.1,12.6,16.7,3.3,0.6,1.7,2.3,3.3,13.7,3.0,Brooklyn Nets

Note: The EuroLeague is not the only competition in which the player participated for the team during the season. He also played in domestic competition, and regional competition if applicable. Kanter is a professional wrestling fan and has previously expressed interest in pursing a professional wrestling career. Kanter has had online feuds with professional wrestlers including All Elite Wrestling's MJF. On 9 September 2019, Kanter made a special appearance at a WWE Monday Night Raw event at Madison Square Garden, where prior to Raw going on the air he defeated WWE 24/7 Champion R-Truth to win the title, though he would lose it back to R-Truth moments later (all of which was shown later during the Raw broadcast). Kanter dated professional wrestler Dana Brooke until December 2019.  Kanter received primary and secondary education at Hizmet schools in Turkey and reconnected with the movement's volunteers when Kanter arrived in the United States,even forming a personal relationship with the movement's founder, Fethullah Gülen. Kanter said he became publicly critical of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2013 due to the corruption scandal in Turkey.After the failed 2016 coup d'état attempt, Kanter criticised Turkish president Erdoğan on Twitter, calling him the ""Hitler of our century"". Soon after the coup attempt in July, his father and his family publicly disowned him due to his political views and his support for Gülen, imploring him to change his surname, on August 8. Kanter stated that he loves Gülen ""more than his family"", informally changing his name to Enes Gülen. His father was dismissed from his university position a few weeks later, via government decree numbered 272 on 1 September, as part of 2016–17 Turkish purges. Also, Kanter has received backlash from former NBA player Hedo Turkoglu. Turkoglu has called Kanter’s comments “irrational”.  In May 2017, while on a tour hosting basketball camps in Hong Kong and Japan and other parts of Asia, Kanter was in Jakarta, Indonesia. At 2:30 AM, Kanter's manager knocked on his door with alarming information. He was told that two men identifying themselves as Indonesian government officials had visited the camp and wanted to speak to find out if Kanter was sleeping at the camp, which he often did.Kanter, staying at a hotel with his manager, instead immediately left Indonesia,going to Singapore, then Bucharest, Romania via Frankfurt, Germany.On 20 May 2017, when trying to fly into Romania – where another camp was planned to be held – Kanter was not allowed into the country, and was told by officials there that his passport was cancelled by the Turkish embassy. Kanter was temporarily stranded in Romania, but eventually flew to London, and then back to the United States. While stuck in Romania, Kanter took to Twitter to explain his situation and the hashtag #FreeEnes went viral - this was all happening during Kanter's birthday. Upon landing in the US, Kanter said the first thing he did was pray. In Turkey, Kanter's father was charged as a member of a terrorist group. He was arrested, then was released after being detained for five days. Kanter believes his father has been targeted by the Turkish government and could face many years in prison. Kanter is unable to contact his friends and family back in Turkey because he fears the conversations will be tapped and they will be harmed. Six days after the cancellation of his passport, the Turkish government issued an arrest warrant for Kanter, accusing him of being a member of a ""terror group"". Turkey said that charged citizens who fail to come to Turkey during September 2017 face revocation of citizenship; in September 2017, Kanter described himself as stateless. According to Sports Illustrated, ""Although Kanter might dismiss the Turkish arrest warrant as toothless, he faces the more impactful problem of being a man without a country."" It was reported on 20 December 2017, that Turkish prosecutors were seeking more than four years in prison for Kanter, who would be tried in absentia. In January 2019, he decided against travelling to London with the Knicks, fearing that his life could be in danger if he traveled to Europe. Kanter did not travel to Toronto with the Portland Trail Blazers in March 2019 for the same reason. According to a 2019 ESPN story, FBI agents have issued him a communications device that allows him to contact the organization at a moment's notice due to credible threats against his life. Also in January 2019, Turkey put an extradition request on Kanter and requested that Interpol put a red notice for his arrest. However, according to Interpol’s website no red notice had been issued. In 2019, Kanter was the subject of an E:60 ESPN documentary called Enemy of the State.Kanter condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria against U.S.-allied Kurds. During the summer of 2018, Kanter held 16 free basketball camps in the United States. In the summer of 2019, 40 free basketball camps were initially scheduled, but he ultimately hosted 50. Another 50 free camps are planned for the summer of 2020. Kanter is a practicing Muslim. In 2019, he wrote in The Washington Post about the challenge of observing Ramadan during the NBA playoffs, which includes long periods of fasting while still playing NBA basketball games. Kanter has said that during college he learned English by watching SpongeBob SquarePants and Jersey Shore. Kanter's younger brother, Kerem Kanter, played for the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay from 2014 to 2017. After graduating from UW–Green Bay in 2017, he transferred to Xavier University under the NCAA's graduate transfer rule.

He finished second in the NBA in three-point percentage and fourth in three-point field goals made with 189. He made at least one three-pointer in his final 73 games of the season, the longest active streak in the NBA at the time, a career-best and the fourth longest streak in league history (Dana Barros 89, Michael Adams 79, Dennis Scott 78). In addition, his 189 made threes was the fourth-best single season total in franchise history.On July 12, 2013, Korver re-signed with the Hawks to a four-year, $24 million contract. On December 6, 2013, Korver passed the NBA record for most consecutive games with a made three-pointer (90) originally set by Dana Barros (89). The streak eventually ended at 127 games on March 5, 2014. Korver finished the 2013–14 season with a 47.2 percent three-point shooting percentage which led the NBA. On December 15, 2014, Korver passed Jason Richardson for 15th all-time in three-pointers made. Five days later, in the Hawks' 104–97 win over the Houston Rockets, Korver scored a game-high 22 points and made all four of his free-throw attempts.

Four days later, in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Korver left the game with a broken nose after taking an offensive foul from Ed Davis with 8:59 left in the first half. The injury ended a streak of 51 consecutive games with a three-pointer by Korver, who missed both of his shots from behind the arc. After missing three games with the injury, he returned to action on March 22 against the San Antonio Spurs with protective gear on his face to cover the nose. Despite having the mask, on March 31, 2015 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Korver made four straight long-range shots, including three 3-pointers, in a 65-second span. On April 29, 2015, Korver was named the recipient of the Joe Dumars Trophy for winning the 2014–15 NBA Sportsmanship Award. During the 2015 playoffs, Korver suffered a right ankle sprain playing against the Cleveland Cavaliers on May 22 in the Eastern Conference Finals. The following day, he was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs. On November 6, 2015, Korver scored 22 points, hitting all eight of his shots, including four from three-point range, as the Hawks won their sixth straight with a 121–115 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 26, in a win over the New York Knicks, Korver hit one three-pointer and passed Rashard Lewis for ninth place on the all-time list for three-pointers made. However, his late December shooting slump marked one of the worst shooting stretches of his career. In four games between December 23–29, Korver shot 5-of-33 from the field and a woeful 2-of-27 from three-point range. Korver continued to struggle with his shot in January, missing all six of his shots on January 31 against the Miami Heat, marking just the third time in his career that he went 0-of-6 or worse as a starter. Over 47 games to begin the season, his 42% field goal shooting was the worst it had been since the 2004–05 season, and his 37% three-point shooting was a career-low success rate.

13888,2470,Zach LaVine,Zachary LaVine,G,6-6,181.0,March 10 1995,"Renton, Washington",False,/players/l/lavinza01.html,5.0,"[18, 5]","Zachary LaVine (born March 10, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected in the first round of the 2014 NBA draft with the 13th overall pick by the Timberwolves. He is a two-time Slam Dunk Contest champion. LaVine grew up in Washington, where he was honored as the state's top high school player. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. After one season at UCLA, he entered the NBA after being named one of the top freshmen in the Pac-12 Conference. As a rookie with Minnesota, he won the league's Slam Dunk Contest, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In 2016, he became the fourth NBA player to ever win consecutive dunk contests. LaVine was born in Renton, Washington, to athletic parents. His father, Paul, played American football professionally in the United States Football League (USFL) and National Football League (NFL), and his mother, CJ, was a softball player.Around the age of five, LaVine developed an interest in basketball after watching Michael Jordan in Space Jam.He later became a fan of Kobe Bryant, and modeled his game after his childhood idol.LaVine practiced playing in the family backyard, where his father had him repeatedly emulate the NBA's Three-Point Shootout.He attended Bothell High School in Bothell, Washington.Playing point guard, he was their primary ball handler. By his junior year, he had grown to 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), and he would practice dunking for hours in his backyard after his shooting routine would end.As a senior, he averaged 28.5 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 2.5 assists per game, and was named the 2013 Associated Press Washington state player of the year and Washington Mr. Basketball.He was also recognized nationally as a first-team Parade All-American.He played in the Ballislife All-American Game, and won the event's slam dunk contest.Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, LaVine was listed as the No. 12 shooting guard and the No. 44 player in the nation in 2013.On June 20, 2012, LaVine verbally committed to attending UCLA and playing for coach Ben Howland for the 2013 season.After Howland was fired nine months later, LaVine considered staying in-state and attending the University of Washington instead. However, he decided to remain with UCLA and their new coach, Steve Alford; LaVine had inherited an affection for UCLA from his father, who grew up a fan of Bruins basketball while growing up in nearby San Bernardino, California. After a strong start to 2013–14 as the team's sixth man, featuring an impressive display of outside shooting and explosive dunks, the former point guard LaVine evoked memories of former Bruin Russell Westbrook's UCLA beginnings.NBA draft pundits began ranking LaVine high on their projections for the 2014 NBA draft if he declared himself eligible. ESPN.com draft expert Chad Ford attributed LaVine's appeal to the Westbrook comparisons. At one point, Ford listed him as the 10th overall pick, while NBADraft.net ranked him fifth.During the season, LaVine typically entered the game with coach Alford's freshman son, Bryce Alford, who usually handled the ball, while starter Kyle Anderson was the team's main facilitator. During a six-game span beginning on January 26, 2014, he endured a shooting slump where he made just 7 of 36 shots from the field. He averaged 9.4 points per game during the season, fourth best on the team, and his 48 three-point field goals made were the second most by a freshman in the school's history. However, LaVine did not reach double-figures in scoring in 14 of the final 18 games, and totaled just 11 points and was 0 for 8 on three-point attempts in the final five games. Despite his late-season struggles, he was voted to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team, and he was named with Bryce Alford as the team's most valuable freshmen. On April 16, 2014, he declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility. On June 26, 2014, LaVine was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 13th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft. The Timberwolves drafted him more for his long-term potential than for immediate returns. He signed his rookie scale contract with the team on July 8, 2014. During the offseason, he won the slam dunk contest at the Seattle Basketball Pro-Am League while using many of the same moves he used to capture the Ballislife contest. Over the first five games of the 2014–15 season, LaVine played a total of 12 minutes. When an ankle injury sidelined starter Ricky Rubio indefinitely, LaVine became the starting point guard over veteran Mo Williams. After being switched back to the bench by coach Flip Saunders in favor of Williams, LaVine scored 28 points in a 120–119 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on November 28. He became only the second teenager ever in the NBA to have at least 25 points and five assists as a reserve. LaVine moved back into the starting lineup after back spasms sidelined Williams. On December 6 against the San Antonio Spurs, LaVine had 22 points and 10 assists for his first double-double. He became just the fourth teenage player to record a 20-point, 10-assist game in the NBA.[b] Rubio returned in February 2015, resulting in a dip in playing time for LaVine. However, Williams was also traded that month to open up more opportunities. Again incorporating moves from the Ballislife contest two years earlier, LaVine won the Slam Dunk Contest during the 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend.He became the youngest champion since an 18-year-old Kobe Bryant in 1997. LaVine became a crowd favorite after his first dunk, which he performed while wearing Jordan's No. 23 jersey from the movie Space Jam. With a perfect 50 on each of his first two dunks, he was the first player since Dwight Howard in 2009 with a perfect score on multiple dunks. Yahoo! Sports hailed him as ""the most electrifying performer of All-Star Saturday Night... and, if we're being honest, in quite a number of years."" LaVine also participated in the Rising Stars Challenge that weekend. On April 11, LaVine had a season-best game with 37 points and nine rebounds in a loss to the Golden State Warriors. For the season, LaVine played in 77 games, starting in 40, and averaged 10.1 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 3.6 assists, while shooting 42.2 percent overall and 34.1 percent on three-pointers. He was subsequently named to the All-NBA Rookie Second Team. On October 21, 2015, the Timberwolves exercised their third-year team option on LaVine's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season. With Ricky Rubio sidelined in early November, LaVine took over the starting point guard role and took advantage of the increased minutes. On November 13, he scored a season-high 26 points in a loss to the Indiana Pacers. He later topped that mark on December 13, scoring 28 points in a loss to the Phoenix Suns. In a 114–107 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 25, 2016, LaVine, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Andrew Wiggins became the first trio of NBA teammates under age 21 to score at least 20 points in the same game. On January 27, he scored 35 points against the Oklahoma City Thunder, just two points shy of his career high. His 35 points set a franchise record for a bench player and set the highest scoring total by a non-starter in the league in 2015–16. He tied Minnesota single-game records with a shooting percentage of 82.4 (14 for 17) and most two-point field goals without a miss (9 for 9). During the 2016 All-Star Weekend, LaVine scored 30 points for Team USA in the Rising Stars Challenge to capture MVP honors. He also became the fourth player ever to win consecutive Slam Dunk Contests.[c] His battle with Aaron Gordon through two tie-breakers in the final round drew comparisons to the showdown between Jordan and Dominique Wilkins in 1988. On October 24, 2016, the Timberwolves exercised their fourth-year team option on LaVine's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2017–18 season. On November 9, he tied his career high with 37 points in a 123–107 win over the Orlando Magic. On December 23, he scored a career-high 40 points and tied a career best with seven three-pointers in a 109–105 loss against the Sacramento Kings. He had 19 points in the second quarter, marking his second-highest quarter of his career; he previously had 20 in the fourth against Golden State on April 11, 2015. On February 4, 2017, LaVine was ruled out for the rest of the season after an MRI revealed he had a torn ACL in his left knee. Ten days later, he underwent successful surgery to reconstruct the knee. On June 22, 2017, LaVine was traded, along with Kris Dunn and the rights to Lauri Markkanen (the 7th pick in the 2017 NBA draft), to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Jimmy Butler and the rights to Justin Patton (the 16th pick in the 2017 NBA draft). On January 13, 2018, in his first game in 11 months, LaVine scored 14 points in the Bulls' 107–105 win over the Detroit Pistons. On February 9, he scored a season-high 35 points in a 114–113 win over his former team the Minnesota Timberwolves. On July 6, 2018, the restricted free agent LaVine received a four-year, $80 million offer sheet from the Sacramento Kings. Two days later, the Bulls exercised their right of first refusal and matched the offer sheet extended to LaVine by the Kings. LaVine scored at least 30 points in each of the Bulls' first three games of the season, becoming the third Chicago player to do so, joining Michael Jordan (1986) and Bob Love (1971). On October 24, he made two free throws with 0.5 seconds left to lift the Bulls to a 112–110 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He finished with 32 points for his fourth straight 30-point game to start the season. On November 5, he scored a career-high 41 points, including the game-winning free throw with 0.2 seconds left, as the Bulls beat the New York Knicks 116–115 in double overtime. On November 10, he scored 24 points in a 99–98 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, thus scoring 20 or more points in each of Chicago's 13 games to begin the season and in a career-high 14 straight overall, dating to his final game of 2017–18. The last Bulls player to score 20-plus points in 14 consecutive games was Jimmy Butler, who did it 15 straight times in 2016. He scored 26 points against the Dallas Mavericks on November 12 for 15 straight, before a 10-point game on November 14 against the Boston Celtics ended the streak. On December 26, after missing five games with a sprained left ankle, LaVine had 28 points in 26 minutes off the bench in a 119–94 loss to the Timberwolves. On February 23, 2019, he scored a career-high 42 points in a 126–116 win over the Celtics. On March 1, he scored 47 points in a 168–161 quadruple-overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks, the third highest scoring game in NBA history. On March 6, he scored 39 points and hit the go-ahead layup in the closing seconds to lift the Bulls to a 108–107 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. LaVine missed the end of the season with right leg injuries. On November 23, 2019, LaVine scored a career high 49 points, with 13 three-point field goals, including the game-winning three pointer to defeat the Charlotte Hornets 116–115.

He played AAU basketball for Leo Papile with the Boston Amateur Basketball Club (BABC).As a senior, he averaged 26 points, five blocks, and four assists per game. ESPN rated him the 17th-best small forward nationally and the 3rd-best player in Massachusetts.Layman was selected as the 2012 HockomockSports.com Boys' Basketball Player of the Year.He was also chosen as the Hockomock League's Most Valuable Player for boys' basketball in 2012.Layman was recruited by Massachusetts native and then Maryland assistant basketball coach, Scott Spinelli. When he first stepped on the College Park campus, ""He started 17 games and averaged 5.5 points per game as a freshman.His game initially centered around shooting 3-pointers and he even described himself as a guard.Layman gained attention for his long wavy hair, which he began growing out as a freshman. His hair even got its own Twitter account.Layman improved his averages to 11.7 points and 5.0 rebounds per game as a sophomore. He had 61 3-pointers and 27 blocks.After his sophomore year, Layman embarked on a rigorous personal training program with David Atkins and graduate assistant John Auslander to improve his strength and ballhandling. After breaking his hand in June 2014, Auslander attached Layman to Velcro pulleys to build arm muscle and used a squatting machine that did not require the use of his hands.“From the end of his sophomore year to end of his junior year, Jake improved as much as any player I’ve ever coached,” according to Mark Turgeon.Teammates described Layman as a quiet leader who led by example.Layman scored 21 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in a win at Oklahoma State on December 21.He had 23 points and 12 rebounds in a 75-59 win against Michigan State on January 17 and scored the last 10 points for the Terrapins.It resulted in him breaking out of a 5-for-23 shooting slump that spanned two games prior.As a junior, Layman was a Third-team All-Big Ten selection by the media.

Layman averaged 11.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, shooting 50 percent from the field and 39.6 percent from three-point range. Layman has drawn comparisons to NBA forward Chandler Parsons. Both players have the size to grab rebounds but also the shooting ability to hit 3-pointers. Of the comparison, Layman noted, “I feel like his game fits a little more in the N.B.A. than in the college game, and that’s what I feel like. I think I’m a guy that doesn’t have to have the ball in his hands all the time to really make an impact. I feel like I could be one of those guys that hangs out in the perimeter and just shoots 3s and slashes to the basket when he needs to.”On June 23, 2016, Layman was selected by the Orlando Magic with the 47th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft.

However, he struggled on defense, and his playing time fell as Indiana coach Nate McMillan tightened his rotation. In December 2017, Leaf was assigned to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA G League and averaged 23.3 points and 8.3 rebounds in a three-game stint before returning to the Pacers. He finished with 52 games played during the regular season, but saw limited playing time towards the end as the Pacers qualified for the playoffs.

On February 28, 2019, he had a career-high 18 points in a season-high 22 minutes in a 122–115 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Leaf was forced into the game early after Turner and O'Quinn got into foul trouble guarding the Wolves' Karl-Anthony Towns, and held his own defensively against the All-Star center. In the regular-season finale, Leaf had career highs of 28 points and 10 rebounds in a 135–134 win over the Atlanta Hawks. Leaf worked on his jump shot during the offseason leading up to the 2019–20 season.

Before being drafted, he played two seasons for the Maryland Terrapins of the Atlantic Coast Conference, as well as a season with Dnipro in his home nation's top professional basketball league. Len was born in Antratsyt, Luhansk, Ukraine to a mother named Yulia, who ran track early in her life. Growing up, Len participated in gymnastics and liked watching Jackie Chan films.As a young gymnast, Len was trained by Oleksiy Stepanenko, who had also trained Olympic gold medalist Ihor Korobchynskyi.He started playing basketball at the age of 13 and later attended Dnipropetrovsk Higher College in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine.He played for the Ukraine national team at the 2009 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship and the 2010 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, where during the 2010 tournament, he was the fourth-best overall scorer, second-best rebounder, and the best shot blocker. Following the tournament, Len joined BC Dnipro of the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague for the 2010–11 season. Len was recruited by then Maryland assistant basketball coach, Scott Spinelli. He was the recipient of an athletic scholarship from the University of Maryland coach Gary Williams, but Williams resigned after the 2010–11 season. Mark Turgeon was hired to take his place. While Williams began recruiting Len, it was Turgeon and Spinelli who eventually lured him to Maryland.Len underachieved in his freshman year, averaging 6 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game, but showed lottery pick potential after serving a ten game suspension at the beginning of the year due to NCAA amateurism issues resulting from his play with BC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, a European club team from his home nation. Len opened his sophomore season on November 9, 2012 against the reigning champion Kentucky Wildcats, led by ESPN's #1 player of the 2012 recruiting class, Nerlens Noel.

On April 7, he scored a career-high 33 points, including a career-best six 3-pointers, in a 115–107 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On February 6, 2020, Len and Jabari Parker were traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dewayne Dedmon. Len played for Ukraine's Under-16 national team during the 2009 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship. Despite his performance throughout the tournament, which included a 20-point outing against Israel and averaging 8.0 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and being the second-best shot blocker in the tournament with 2.6 blocks per game, the Under-16 national team was relegated under the Division B section after the tournament for over a year's time. He played with his nation's Under-18 national team for the 2010 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. Unlike in the Under-16 Tournament he participated in back in 2009, Len helped the Under-18 team stay in the Division A tournaments for at least another year. Throughout the tournament, Len ended up being the biggest stand-out player for the nation throughout the entire tournament. In fact, his performance throughout the tournament led to the University of Maryland, along with a few other universities like Virginia Tech, gaining enough interest in him to get him on their team.In August 2018, Len was named to play for the Ukraine national basketball team for the first time at the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers in September. In December 2015, Len and his mother, Yulia, created the Len-d A Hand Foundation, a charity that helps reach out to the youth in Phoenix, Arizona and other surrounding areas. Len is also a strong swimmer. On April 25, 2016, he helped save his friend and a lifeguard from drowning at a beach in the Dominican Republic.",26414,2509,2019-20,40.0,9.0,745.0,6.9,12.6,0.546,0.7,2.7,0.25,6.2,9.9,0.627,2.5,3.9,0.63,3.3,7.8,11.1,2.0,1.0,1.6,1.9,4.5,16.9,1.0,Atlanta Hawks

He played two seasons of college basketball for the San Diego State Aztecs and was named a consensus second-team All-American as a sophomore. Leonard opted to forgo his final two seasons at San Diego State to enter the 2011 NBA draft. He was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 15th overall pick before being traded to the San Antonio Spurs on draft night. With the Spurs, Leonard won an NBA championship in 2014, where he was named the Finals Most Valuable Player. After seven seasons with the Spurs, Leonard was traded to the Toronto Raptors in 2018. In 2019, he led the Raptors to their first NBA championship in franchise history and won his second Finals MVP award. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles and signed with the Clippers as a free agent in July 2019. Leonard is a four-time All-Star with two All-NBA First Team selections. Nicknamed the ""Claw,"" or ""Klaw,"" for his ball-hawking skills, he has earned five All-Defensive Team selections and won Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2015 and 2016. Leonard attended Canyon Springs High School in Moreno Valley, California, before transferring to Martin Luther King High School for his junior year. In his senior year there, he and Tony Snell led the King High Wolves to a 30–3 record. Leonard averaged 22.6 points, 13.1 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 3 blocks per game that year and was named California Mr. Basketball.Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Leonard was listed in the recruiting rankings of 2009 as the No. 8 small forward and the No. 48 player nationwide.As a freshman at San Diego State University in 2009–10,Leonard averaged 12.7 points and 9.9 rebounds per game for the Aztecs.He helped the team achieve a 25–9 record and led them to win the Mountain West Conference (MWC) tournament title. The Aztecs thus received an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournamentbut would lose in the first round to Tennessee, 62–59, with Leonard recording 12 points and 10 rebounds.He led the MWC in rebounding and was named MWC Freshman of the Year, First Team All-MWC, and the 2010 MWC Tournament MVP.During his sophomore season, Leonard averaged 15.7 points and 10.4 rebounds per contestas the Aztecs finished with a 34–3 record and won back-to-back conference tournament championships. Led by Leonard, San Diego State once again made the NCAA tournament. This time the Aztecs advanced to the Sweet 16, but then they lost to eventual national champions, Connecticut. Leonard was named to the Second Team All-America and left San Diego State to enter the 2011 NBA draft. On February 1, 2020, SDSU retired Leonard’s number 15, making him the first player in program history to receive this honor. According to Sports Illustrated, NBA scouts were aware in 2011 that Leonard had a strong work ethic and was a ""physical marvel, 6'7"" with a 7'3"" wingspan and 11-inch hands, too strong to screen and too long to elude"". Nevertheless, they found him ""difficult to pin down"". Sporting News has asserted that Leonard was known more for his defense and rebounding than for his offensive capabilities when he first entered the league. He was compared to Metta World Peace and Gerald Wallace, and his outside shooting (or lack thereof) was a concern. Leonard was selected with the 15th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Indiana Pacers but was traded that night to the San Antonio Spurs along with the rights to Erazem Lorbek and Dāvis Bertāns in exchange for George Hill. On December 10, 2011, following the conclusion of the NBA lockout, he signed a multi-year deal with the Spurs. Leonard and teammate Tiago Splitter were selected to play in the 2012 Rising Stars Challenge as members of Team Chuck. Although he suited up for the event, he did not play due to a calf strain. After starter Richard Jefferson was traded to the Golden State Warriors for Stephen Jackson, Leonard was promoted to the starting small forward position while Jackson served as his backup. At season's end, Leonard placed fourth in Rookie of the Year voting and was named to the 2012 NBA All-Rookie First Team. In the summer of 2012, Leonard was among several NBA up-and-comers chosen to play for the 2012 USA men's basketball Select Team. They trained with the Olympic team, which included Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Chris Paul. On October 26, 2012, the Spurs exercised the team option on Leonard, re-signing him through the 2013–14 season. Leonard was selected to play for the BBVA Rising Stars Challenge where he was once again drafted to Team Chuck. He recorded 20 points and 7 rebounds as Team Chuck defeated Team Shaq for the second straight year 163–135. The San Antonio Spurs advanced to the NBA Finals where they faced the Miami Heat. Leonard averaged 14.6 points and 11.1 rebounds during the Finals as the Spurs lost the series in seven games. On April 6, 2014, Leonard scored a season-high 26 points in the Spurs' 112–92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. He finished the season averaging 12.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.7 steals while shooting 52.2% from the field. Leonard helped the Spurs to a 62–20 record – the number one seed in the NBA – and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the first time. The Spurs and the Miami Heat met once again in the NBA Finals. On June 10, 2014, in Game 3 of the series, Leonard scored a then career-high 29 points in a 111–92 victory. San Antonio went on to win the series 4–1. Leonard averaged 17.8 points on 61% shooting and was named NBA Finals MVP. He was the third-youngest winner of the award (22 years and 351 days), behind only Magic Johnson—who won in both 1980 (20 years and 278 days) and 1982 (22 years and 298 days). Leonard was also only the sixth player, and the first since Chauncey Billups in 2004, to win Finals MVP in a season in which they were not an All-Star. After missing the final six preseason games and the season opener against the Dallas Mavericks due to an infection in his right eye caused by conjunctivitis, Leonard made his season debut against the Phoenix Suns on October 31 despite still suffering from blurry vision. He continued to play through the blurred vision and on November 10, 2014, he scored a season-high 26 points in the Spurs' 89–85 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Following a three-game stint on the sidelines between December 17 and 20, Leonard had an injection in his injured right hand on December 22 and was ruled out indefinitely. He returned to action on January 16, 2015, after missing 15 games, recording 20 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals to lead the Spurs to a 110–96 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. On April 5, Leonard recorded 26 points and a career-high 7 steals in a 107–92 win over the Golden State Warriors. On April 23, Leonard was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, joining Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players to win both NBA Defensive Player of the Year and NBA Finals MVP. The next day, he scored a playoff career-high 32 points in a Game 3 first-round playoff series victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. The Spurs went on to lose the series in seven games. On July 16, 2015, Leonard re-signed with the Spurs to a five-year, $90 million contract. On October 28, he scored a then career-high 32 points in a 112–106 season-opening loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On December 3, he scored 27 points and made a career-high seven three-pointers in a 103–83 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. On January 21, 2016, he was named as a starter to the Western Conference team for the 2016 All-Star Game, earning his first All-Star selection and became the sixth Spurs player in franchise history to be selected as an All-Star starter, joining George Gervin, Larry Kenon, Alvin Robertson, David Robinson and Tim Duncan. On March 23, 2016, Leonard had another 32-point outing in a 112–88 win over the Miami Heat, helping the Spurs extend their franchise-record home winning streak to 45 games (dating to 2014–15 season). On April 2, he set a new career-high with 33 points in a 102–95 win over the Toronto Raptors, helping the Spurs set a franchise record with their 64th victory. The Spurs topped their 63-win season in 2005–06 and extended their NBA-record home winning streak to start the season to 39 games. Leonard helped the Spurs finish second in the Western Conference with a 67–15 record, and earned Defensive Player of the Year honors for a second straight year, becoming the first non-center to win the honor in back-to-back seasons since Dennis Rodman in 1989–90 and 1990–91. Additionally, he finished runner-up in the MVP voting behind Stephen Curry. In Game 3 of the first-round playoffs against the Memphis Grizzlies, Leonard helped the Spurs go up 3–0 in the series with a 32-point effort, tying his playoff career-high. After sweeping the Grizzlies, the Spurs moved on to face the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round. In Game 3 of the series against the Thunder, Leonard helped his team go up 2–1 with 31 points and 11 rebounds. However, the Spurs went on to lose the next three games, bowing out of the playoffs with a 4–2 defeat. In the Spurs' season opener on October 25, 2016, Leonard recorded a career-high 35 points and five steals in a 129–100 win over the Golden State Warriors. On January 14, 2017, he set a new career high with 38 points in a 108–105 loss to the Phoenix Suns, becoming the first Spur to record three consecutive 30-point games since Tony Parker in 2012. On January 19, he was named a starter for the Western Conference All-Star team in the 2017 NBA All-Star Game and had 34 points against the Denver Nuggets for his fifth straight 30-point performance. Two days later, he set a new career high with 41 points in a 118–115 overtime win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, becoming the first San Antonio player to score at least 30 in six straight games since Mike Mitchell in 1986. He subsequently earned Western Conference Player of the Week honors for games played from January 16 through 22. On February 13, 2017, Leonard made 13 of 23 shots including two three-pointers and finished with 32 points, six rebounds and four steals in a 110–106 win over the Indiana Pacers. It was his fifth straight 30-point game. With their 42nd victory of the season coming against the Pacers, the Spurs extended their streak of consecutive winning seasons to a league-record 20. On March 6, after being named Player of the Week for the fourth time in his career, Leonard scored 39 points to lead the Spurs to a 112–110 win over the Houston Rockets. It was his 91st straight game scoring in double figures, matching San Antonio's longest streak since Tim Duncan did so in 2002–03. On April 15, 2017, Leonard matched his postseason high with 32 points in a 111–82 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. Two days later, in Game 2, Leonard had a postseason career-high 37 points and added 11 rebounds in a 96–82 win over Memphis to take a 2–0 series lead. In Game 4 of the series in Memphis, Leonard had another postseason personal best with 43 points in a 110–108 overtime loss; the loss tied the series at 2–2. Behind a 29-point effort from Leonard in Game 6, the Spurs advanced to the Western Conference semifinals by beating Memphis 103–96 to take the series 4–2. The Spurs went on to advance to the Western Conference Finals with a 4–2 triumph over the Houston Rockets in the second round, despite playing without Leonard in Game 6 due to an ankle injury. In the third quarter of Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Leonard landed on Zaza Pachulia's foot after attempting a field goal and re-aggravated his existing ankle injury. He exited the game with 26 points and sat out the remainder of the series as the Spurs lost to the Warriors in four games. Leonard finished the season with averages of 25.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.8 steals per game in the regular season, and 27.7 points, 7.8 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 1.7 steals for the playoffs. He was subsequently selected to the All-NBA First Team for the second straight year, as well as earning All-Defensive First Team honors for the third consecutive season. Leonard missed the first 27 games of the season with a right quadriceps injury, making his season debut on December 12, 2017, against the Dallas Mavericks. He appeared in nine games between December 12 and January 13. He returned from a three-game absence on January 13 against the Denver Nuggets after straining his left shoulder against the Phoenix Suns on January 5. On January 17, he was ruled out for an indefinite period of time to continue his rehabilitation process from right quadriceps tendinopathy. Leonard was subsequently cleared to play by the Spurs medical staff, but he solicited a second opinion from his own doctors. In March, the Spurs held a players-only meeting in which Leonard's teammates reportedly entreated him to return to the court; the meeting was described as ""tense and emotional"". Leonard did not play again in 2018. In June 2018, reports surfaced claiming that Leonard had requested a trade from the Spurs and that he did so after months of tension between his camp and the Spurs stemming from a disagreement over his injury rehabilitation program. A month later, on July 18, Leonard and teammate Danny Green were traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Pöltl and a protected 2019 first-round draft pick. It was a risky move for the Raptors and their president, Masai Ujiri, given the concerns over Leonard's health and the possibility of him leaving as a free agent at the end of the season. In his debut for the Raptors in their season opener on October 17, Leonard had 24 points and 12 rebounds in a 116–104 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Two days later, he had 31 points and 10 rebounds in a 113–101 win over the Boston Celtics. Leonard was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played November 26 – December 2. On January 1, he scored a career-high 45 points in a 122–116 win over the Utah Jazz. On January 31 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Leonard's career-high streak of scoring at least 20 points in 22 consecutive games ended when he had 16 points in a 105–92 loss. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Philadelphia 76ers, Leonard had a playoff career-high 45 points, on 16-of-23 (69.6%) shooting, to lead the Raptors in a 108–95 victory. He became just the second player in Raptors history to eclipse 40 points in a playoff game, joining Vince Carter (50 points, 2001). In the deciding Game 7, Leonard hit a shot from the corner at the buzzer that bounced off the rim four times before falling to give the Raptors a 92–90 victory over the 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. He finished the game with 41 points on 16-of-39 shooting. This was the first Game 7 buzzer beater in NBA history and caused the normally calm Leonard to let out a victorious scream as he was swarmed by his teammates. Leonard said of the shot afterward: The Raptors continued their 2019 NBA Playoffs march against the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks. In Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Leonard scored 36 points, including eight in the second overtime, to help the Raptors beat Milwaukee 118–112 to cut the Bucks' series lead to 2–1. In Game 5, he helped the Raptors take a 3–2 lead with 35 points on five 3-pointers to go with seven rebounds and nine assists in a 105–99 win. In Game 6, he had 27 points and 17 rebounds to lead the Raptors into the NBA Finals for the first time with a 100–94 victory. Leonard put an exclamation point on the conference victory with a huge dunk on Giannis Antetokounmpo that was set up by a Kyle Lowry steal. Leonard led the Raptors into the 2019 Finals on the back of what was being described as an all-time great NBA playoff performance. In Game 2, Leonard had 34 points and 14 rebounds in a 109–104 loss to Golden State. Leonard helped the Raptors take a 3–1 series lead with 36 points and 12 rebounds in a 105–92 Game 4 win on the road in Oakland. In Game 6, he scored 22 points in a 114–110 win to help lift the Raptors to a 4–2 series victory in claiming his second NBA championship. He was subsequently named NBA Finals MVP for the second time, becoming just the third Finals MVP to have won the award with two teams, joining LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He is also the first person to win Finals MVP with a team from each conference. Leonard scored 732 points during the 2019 playoffs; this was the third-best scoring total for a single NBA postseason in league history, behind only LeBron James (748, 2018) and Michael Jordan (759, 1992). On July 10, 2019, Leonard signed with the Los Angeles Clippers to a reported three-year, $103 million contract, which included an opt-out clause in 2021. Leonard debuted for the Clippers on October 22, 2019, where he put up 30 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists in a 112–102 win against the Los Angeles Lakers. On October 24, he recorded 21 points and tied a career-high 9 assists in a 141–122 win over the Golden State Warriors. On December 11, Leonard returned to Toronto for the first since joining the Clippers and was met with a tribute and a standing ovation from the crowd before scoring 23 points and recording six assists in 112–92 win over the Raptors. Two days later, Leonard scored a then season-high 42 points along with 11 rebounds in a 124–117 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. It was the first time in franchise history that two players eclipsed 40 points, as teammate Paul George scored 46 points. On Christmas Day, the Clippers and Lakers met once again in a much anticipated matchup, in which Leonard put up 35 points on 11-of-19 shooting and 12 rebounds to lead the Clippers to a 111–106 comeback win despite trailing by as much as 15. On January 14, 2020, Leonard scored a season-high 43 points in just 29 minutes in a 128–103 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played from January 13 through 19. On January 24, Leonard recorded his first career triple-double with 33 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 122–117 win over the Miami Heat. Leonard is the son of Mark Leonard and Kim Robertson. He is the youngest child of the family and has four sisters. His father was shot and killed on January 18, 2008, at the Compton car wash he owned. Leonard insisted on playing the next evening and broke down emotionally after the game. As of 2019 the murderer had still not been found. Leonard is the cousin of American football wide receiver Stevie Johnson. Leonard's girlfriend, Kishele Shipley, gave birth to their first child in July 2016. In March 2019, the couple welcomed their second child, a boy. In 2018 Leonard reportedly signed a multi-year endorsement deal with New Balance, the multinational sports footwear and apparel corporation. He had previously signed with Air Jordan brand, a subsidiary of Nike. In June 2019, Leonard filed a federal lawsuit against Nike. According to the lawsuit, Nike copyrighted Leonard's ""Klaw"" logo without his consent. Leonard is known for his quiet and private demeanor. He rarely gives interviews and avoids questions about his private life. Leonard has also said that he does not actively consume news media or use social media.",26415,2513,2019-20,42.0,42.0,1364.0,10.5,22.7,0.463,2.3,6.3,0.374,8.2,16.4,0.497,6.8,7.5,0.895,1.1,7.2,8.3,5.9,2.0,0.8,3.4,2.1,30.1,13.0,Los Angeles Clippers

He played college basketball for the Illinois Fighting Illini before being selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the 11th overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft. He also is a content creator for FaZe Clan in his spare time and streams on Twitch.Leonard, born in Woodbridge, Virginia,grew up in Robinson, Illinois, a small town in southeastern Illinois. When he was six years old, his father James, a golf pro, was killed in a freak bicycle accident. His mother Tracie, once an athlete who would run upwards of 10 miles a day, had been largely housebound since her husband's death, victimized by an old horseback injury and subsequent disc surgery that left her with crippling pain.When he was in second grade, the young Leonard gained a surrogate family. Brian Siler, an insurance agent in Robinson who had a son of the same age, was aware of Leonard's family situation, and eventually became a father figure. Leonard regularly attended the Silers' church and went on family vacations. According to ESPN.com writer Dana O'Neil:Leonard entered high school as a guard, but was converted to center after a six-inch (15 cm) growth spurt between his freshman and sophomore years. O'Neil called him ""something of a basketball anomaly"", adding that Leonard ""gained all that height without losing his coordination or his fast-twitch muscles.""In high school, Leonard was named a member of the 2010 Illinois All-State Team as selected by the Associated Press, Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, News-Gazette, and the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association. Leonard led Robinson High School to the IHSA class 2A state championshipbefore choosing to play collegiate basketball at the University of Illinois. As a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 2010–11, Leonard averaged 2.1 points and 1.2 rebounds per game in 8.2 minutes per game for the Fighting Illini.Following the season he was invited to the June 17 – 24, 2011, 17-man tryouts for the 12-man FIBA Under-19 World Championship team by USA Basketball.Leonard was one of 12 selected players that competed as Team USA in the 2011 FIBA U19 World Championships in Latvia from June 30 – July 10, 2011, and placed fifth in the competition.As a sophomore in 2011–12, Leonard averaged 13.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game.Leonard was named Big 10 Co-Player of the Week on December 5, 2011 after averaging 16.5 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in two Illinois victories.Leonard was also named Big 10 Player of the Week on December 26, 2011 after averaging 16.5 points and 14.5 rebounds per game in two games. Following the season, Leonard was named Honorable Mention All Big-10. He then entered the NBA draft. Leonard was drafted with the 11th overall pick by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2012 NBA draft. On July 13 he signed his rookie scale contract with the Trail Blazers. On October 31, 2012, Leonard made his NBA debut, logging 23 minutes and scoring four points against the Los Angeles Lakers. He made his first career start on November 21, 2012, against the Phoenix Suns, finishing with 12 points and 5 rebounds. On March 30, 2013, he had a season-best game with 22 points and 10 rebounds in a loss to the Golden State Warriors. Leonard's numbers dipped from his rookie to sophomore season, falling behind fellow second-year big man Joel Freeland as the primary backup to starter Robin Lopez. He saw action in 29 fewer games in 2013–14, with his minutes and points per game cut in half, as the Blazers transformed from a lottery team to a playoff contender. On January 2, 2014, he had a season-best game with 8 points and 10 rebounds in a 134–104 win over the Charlotte Bobcats. In 2014–15, Leonard played only 13 total minutes in Portland's first 9 games as he was stuck in the big man rotation behind Lopez, Freeland and Chris Kaman. On November 15, 2014, with LaMarcus Aldridge scratched with an upper respiratory illness against the Brooklyn Nets, Leonard picked up the start at power forward, playing 29 minutes. With his first major minutes at the power forward spot, he performed admirably, tallying 12 rebounds and hitting a three-pointer. He went on to pick up DNPs in 11 of the next 12 games. But when Lopez broke his hand going up for a rebound against the San Antonio Spurs on December 15, Leonard got another chance to show that he deserved time on the court. His improvement was incremental, but noticeable, over the following seven weeks. His play while Lopez was out earned him time to prove himself. He only saw six DNPs after the turn of the year, and grew in confidence despite limited minutes. At the season's end, Leonard had produced a remarkable Steve Nash-like 50/40/90 season, shooting 51% from the field, 42% from three-point range, and 93% from the free throw line. In the penultimate game of the regular season on April 13, he scored a career-high 24 points in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. He went on to record a playoff-best game with 13 points and 13 rebounds in a win over the Memphis Grizzlies in Game 4 of Portland's first-round series. The Blazers lost the series 4–1. On December 1, 2015, Leonard scored a season-high 23 points in a loss to the Dallas Mavericks.

On July 10, 2016, Leonard re-signed with the Trail Blazers on a four-year, $41 million contract. On October 8, 2016, he was cleared for all practice activities, six months after undergoing surgery on his left shoulder. On December 23, 2016, he scored a season-high 16 points off the bench in a 110–90 loss to the Spurs. On May 20, 2019, in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, Leonard recorded a career-high 30 points and 12 rebounds in a 119–117 overtime loss to the Golden State Warriors. On July 6, 2019, Leonard was traded to the Miami Heat in a four-team trade. Leonard's older brother, Bailey, is a U.S. Marine who has served in Afghanistan.

He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines. As a freshman for the 2012–13 team, he nearly redshirted but earned a key role off the bench as the team went on to reach the championship game in the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. As a sophomore for the 2013–14 team, he became a regular starter and was selected as a second team 2013–14 All-Big Ten player for the outright Big Ten regular season champions. His junior and senior seasons were interrupted by injury. LeVert is a cousin of Eddie Levert, Gerald Levert and Sean Levert. LeVert grew up in Northeast Columbus but moved to nearby Pickerington in second grade.One of his teammates at Pickerington High School Central was future Ohio State forward Jae'Sean Tate.As a high school senior, he led Pickerington Central to a 26–2 record and the 2012 OHSAA Division I state championship.LeVert was a 2012 Associated Press All-Ohio Second Team high school basketball player and the 2012 Columbus Dispatch Metro Player of the Year for Pickerington High School Central. He was not heavily recruited in high school and his only official visit was to Alabama State.He committed to play basketball for John Groce and the Ohio Bobcats men's basketball program in November 2011.Meanwhile, when future teammates Mitch McGary and Nik Stauskas joined Glenn Robinson III by committing to Michigan in November 2011, Michigan became the fifth best recruiting class in the country.When Groce got hired by Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball in March 2012, LeVert got lost in the shuffle and decided to commit to Michigan.Ironically, Groce's 2011–12 Ohio Bobcats' upset of the 2011–12 Michigan team in the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament was probably the reason that Groce was hired by Illinois and LeVert withdrew his National Letter of Intent to play for Ohio.The 2011–12 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team had been co-champions of 2011–12 Big Ten Conference, but lost both of its co-captains, Zack Novak and Stu Douglass, to graduation and three players as transfers. The team was returning a nucleus of All-Big Ten players Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway, Jr. LeVert arrived at Michigan weighing 152 pounds (68.9 kg).As a freshman, he began the year behind Stauskas, Robinson, Tim Hardaway, Jr., and Matt Vogrich on the depth chart for the shooting guard/small forward positions and did not play in the first six games as a result. LeVert was a part of an incoming class that included McGary, Stauskas, Robinson, and Spike Albrecht. Eventually, Michigan head coach John Beilein decided that LeVert had value as a perimeter defender and decided to play him rather than redshirt him. On December 1 against Bradley Beilein juggled his lineup: Stauskas made his first career regular season start and LeVert saw his first action. By late December, LeVert became the one-on-one partner for Burke after practices. LeVert made his first start on December 29 against Central Michigan, when Tim Hardaway, Jr. was unavailable. The 3 freshmen in the starting lineup—Robinson, Stauskas and LeVert—combined for 48 points, 12 rebounds and 8 assists. That night LeVert tallied 9 points and 5 assists. LeVert averaged 2.3 points in under 11 minutes of play per game. He never scored in double digits as a freshman,but he scored 8 points each in conference wins over Illinois and Michigan State as well as the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament final four victory over Syracuse in 21 minutes of play. LeVert's classmates all made names for themselves as freshmen. During the Spring and Summer semesters (the offseason) of 2013 LeVert and Stauskas trained together on the court and in the weight room. He followed fellow Columbus native and National Player of the Year Burke as a key contributor to Michigan basketball as a sophomore.After opening the season with career-highs of 17 points and 5 rebounds on November 8 against UMass Lowell, he posted 24 points on November 12 against South Carolina State. When Michigan played (#10 AP Poll/ #8 Coaches' Poll) Duke in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge on December 3, LeVert again posted 24 points, including a 7–7 free throw performance. On January 18, Michigan defeated (#3 AP/#3 Coaches) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center for the first time since the 1998–99 team did so on February 27, 1999. It was the highest ranked team Michigan has ever beaten on the road. LeVert contributed a career-high 4 steals and 20 points. LeVert posted his first double double on January 30 at home against Purdue with a career-high 11 rebounds and 14 points. On February 16, Michigan lost to (#21/21) Wisconsin, despite a career-high 25 points from LeVert. Michigan clinched its first outright (unshared) Big Ten Conference championship since 1985–86. He was a 2014 second team 2013–14 All-Big Ten selection (coaches and media). On March 11 LeVert was named to the all-District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) team by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). The 2013–14 team was eliminated in the elite eight round of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament by Kentucky. LeVert and teammate Stauskas, joined Julius Randle, Aaron Harrison and Marcus Lee on the All-Midwest Regional team. On May 12, LeVert underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in his foot. He was expected to be sidelined for 8–10 weeks, but be available for the team's August trip to play in Europe. LeVert returned to action just before the team's August 15–24 10-day, 4-game trip to Italy. Prior to the 2014–15 season, LeVert was named a first team All-Big Ten preseason selection along with Frank Kaminsky, Yogi Ferrell, Terran Petteway, and Sam Dekker. LeVert was selected by NBCSports.com to its Preseason All-American first team, by SB Nation, Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook, Athlon Sports, Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, and CBSSports.com to their second teams and by USA Today to its third team. In its preseason top 100 player ranking, LeVert was listed at number 13 by ESPN. He was also listed as a John R. Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 candidate. LeVert also was named to the Oscar Robertson Trophy Watch List on November 24. He was also included in the early December Naismith Award top 50 watch list. LeVert was named co-captain of the team along with Spike Albrecht. He opened the season with 9 assists against Hillsdale College on November 15, surpassing his previous career-high of five. On November 24, against Oregon, LeVert established a career high by making 11 free throws helping the team to a 70–63 victory in the Legends Classic semifinal game. He posted a career-high 32 points and tied a career-high 4 steals on December 6 in an upset loss to NJIT. He posted 4 steals again against Minnesota on January 10. On January 17 against Northwestern, he reinjured the foot that he had had surgery on the prior May and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). LeVert was on crutches until early March and in a protective walking boot until early April. LeVert had been expected to be a 2015 NBA Draft selection, but following his injury some felt his draft stock was impaired. Following the season, he sought advice from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, but decided that he needed a second evaluation from them as the field of declared underclassmen became more clear with the thinking that ""I don't think it really makes sense to (leave school) early and get drafted in the second round"". On April 21, LeVert announced that he would return for his senior season. According to CBSSports.com's Sam Vecenie, this would give LeVert a chance to improve his pick and roll decision making, his midrange offensive game and his defense, especially against screens. Prior to the 2015–16 season, LeVert was named an All-Big Ten preseason selection, for the second straight year. LeVert became the fourth Wolverine to earn the award multiple times in their career, following Maurice Taylor, LaVell Blanchard and Manny Harris. He was also one of five All-Big Ten preseason selections according to the Big Ten Network. He was one of three Big Ten selections to the 20-man Jerry West Award preseason watchlist (along with James Blackmon, Jr. and Rasheed Sulaimon) announced by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He was an Athlon Sports Preseason All-American 3rd team selection. In preseason top 100 player rankings LeVert was ranked 16 by ESPN and 23 by NBC Sports. He made the initial 50-man John R. Wooden Award watch list on November 17. On December 2, Levert earned recognition on the 50-man Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist and 33-man Robertson Trophy watchlists. After being sidelined for the final 14 games of the prior season for the 2014–15 Wolverines, LeVert began the season with a game-high 18 points and 5 assists as a starter against Northern Michigan. On November 16, against Elon, LeVert tied his career high with four steals. On December 5 against Houston Baptist, LeVert made his first start at point guard while Derrick Walton sat out due to a sprained ankle and posted 25 points and 8 rebounds. On December 8, Michigan lost 82–58 to (19/-) SMU as LeVert slumped on 1–13 field goal shooting and 3–6 free throw shooting. On December 15 against Northern Kentucky, LeVert posted 13 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, becoming the fourth player in Michigan program history to record a triple-double, and the 49th Wolverine to eclipse 1,000 career points. Based on his triple double against Northern Kentucky and a 19-point effort against Youngstown State, LeVert earned Co-Big Ten Player of the Week honors (along with Malcolm Hill) on December 21. On December 30, Michigan defeated Illinois 78–68 in its Big Ten Conference opener as LeVert posted a 22-point, 10-assist double-double. LeVert missed the January 2 game against Penn State with a lower left leg injury. At the time, he was the team leader in points, rebounds and assists. On January 13, LeVert was one of four Big Ten athletes (along with Melo Trimble, Jarrod Uthoff and Denzel Valentine) among the 25 players included in the Wooden Award Midseason Top 25 Watch List. On the eve of LeVert's sixth missed game, head coach Beilein finally clarified that LeVert's left leg injury was not related to the two previous left foot stress fractures that LeVert had endured. On February 2, LeVert was one of two Big Ten athletes (along with Malcolm Hill) named one of 10 finalists for the Jerry West Award, despite having missed the last 8 of Michigan's 22 games. On February 10, Brendan F. Quinn of MLive.com broke the story that LeVert had been cleared to play. On February 13, Michigan defeated (#18/16) Purdue 61–56 with LeVert recording five rebounds and one assist in 11 minutes after missing the previous 11 games. On March 1, the team announced that the injury would end LeVert's season and collegiate career. On March 22, LeVert had a third surgical procedure in 22 months performed on his left foot in New York City by specialist Dr. Martin O'Malley. By late April, the draft stock of LeVert had slipped to the second round. According to the Michigan Basketball Twitter feed, he attended graduation in crutches at the end of April. He was invited to the May 11–15 NBA Draft Combine. While still on crutches at the combine, LeVert clarified that his injury was a Jones fracture of the fifth metatarsal and that Kevin Durant who has the same agency and used the same doctor had called to offer him encouragement. The day before the 2016 NBA draft, LeVert authored an open letter to NBA general managers to assure them of his resiliency in the face of all of his doubters due to his injury. On June 23, LeVert was selected with the 20th overall pick in the 2016 draft by the Indiana Pacers. He became Michigan's fifth first-round draft selection since 2013 and the fourth player drafted from Michigan's 2012 entering class. His rights were later traded to the Brooklyn Nets on July 7, in exchange for Thaddeus Young. Dr. O'Malley, who had performed LeVert's most recent foot surgery, was on the Brooklyn Nets medical staff at the time of the trade. On July 14, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Nets. LeVert missed the 2016 NBA Summer League as well as preseason and resumed practicing near the beginning of the regular season. He began the season sidelined and still rehabbing his injury. He was cleared to play on December 4. He made his professional debut on December 7 against the Denver Nuggets. Although he went 0-of-3 from the field, he posted 4 rebounds and 3 steals in 9 minutes of play, becoming the first Net to post 3 steals in his debut since Chris Childs in 1994. Levert entered at the start of the second quarter and posted 3 steals and 3 rebounds in 5:15 of play before halftime. LeVert scored his first NBA points on December 10 against the San Antonio Spurs on a back door reverse layup assisted by Brook Lopez.

On February 3, Levert made his first NBA start against former Michigan teammate Robinson and the Indiana Pacers. On April 6 against the Orlando Magic, LeVert posted his first 20-point performance. Despite missing a large portion of the season, LeVert almost made the NBA All-Rookie team, finishing 12 in the voting for the 10-man team. When Jeremy Lin was sidelined for the 2017–18 NBA season after the first game, it opened up playing time. After Allen Crabbe started game 2, LeVert entered the starting lineup for game 3 on October 22 against the Atlanta Hawks, posting 16 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals. Coming off the bench on November 6 against the Phoenix Suns, he posted a 5-steal performance, while locking down Devin Booker so well that he frustrated Booker into fouling out. With injuries to point guards Jeremy Lin and D'Angelo Russell, coach Kenny Atkinson was impressed with LeVert rising to the challenge of learning a new position, earning the back-up point guard role to Spencer Dinwiddie. On December 7 (the first anniversary of his NBA debut), he had career highs in points (21) and assists (10) against reigning NBA MVP Russell Westbrook to lead the Nets to a 100–95 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder in Mexico City.

He played college basketball for the Weber State Wildcats and earned third-team All-American honors in 2012.

He has received five NBA All-Star selections and is one of two players in Trail Blazers franchise history, along with Clyde Drexler, to become a five-time All-Star. For his sophomore year, Lillard transferred to St. Joseph Notre Dame High School in Alameda, California, the same private school that had produced former NBA point guard Jason Kidd; but by year's end, a lack of playing time prompted Lillard to transfer schools yet again. He went on to play for coach Orlando Watkins at Oakland High School, where he was First Team All-League his junior and senior years. Over his junior campaign, Lillard averaged 19.4 points a night.As a senior, he averaged 22.4 points and 5.2 assists per game while leading the Oakland Oakers to a 23–9 record.Regarded only as a two-star prospect by Rivals.com,Lillard was not heavily recruited out of high school, but he accepted a scholarship offer to play for Weber State, a Big Sky Conference program in Ogden, Utah.As a freshman at Weber State, Lillard averaged 11.5 points per game and was named the Big Sky Conference Freshman of the Year and first-team All-Big Sky.

In Game 4 of the Trail Blazers' first-round playoff series against the Pelicans, Lillard scored 19 points in a 131–123 loss. The loss eliminated Portland from the playoffs, as they lost the series in a four-game sweep. Lillard never scored more than 20 in the series and was held below that three times. For the season, he was named to the All-NBA First Team, becoming the third player in franchise history to earn All-NBA First Team honors, joining Drexler (1991–92) and Bill Walton (1977–78).

With 31 points and 12 assists in a double-overtime victory over the Brooklyn Nets on March 25, Lillard recorded his 20th career game of at least 30 points and 10 assists, passing Drexler for the most such games in franchise history (19). On April 1, he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the week ending March 31, marking the seventh weekly honor of his career and the first of the 2018–19 season. In April, he became the first Blazer to have 2,000 points and 500 assists in the same season, and the only Blazer besides Drexler to reach 2,000 points in two seasons with the team. He also passed his franchise record of 229 3-pointers set in the 2015–16 season and reached 1,500 for his career. On April 23, Lillard hit a 37-foot, game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer and finished with a playoff career-high 50 points to help the Trail Blazers eliminate the Thunder from the playoffs in five games with a 118–115 victory.

On November 8, 2019, Lillard notched a new career-high in points after scoring 60 points but lost to the visiting Brooklyn Nets, 115–119. Lillard wears the jersey number No. 0, representative for the letter 'O' and his journey in life; from Oakland, to Ogden, and now Oregon.

The 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) small forward went on to play college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels. Little played his freshman and sophomore seasons (2014-16) at Oakleaf High School then transferred to Orlando Christian Prep, where he played for the rest of his high school career.

14434,2576,Kevon Looney,Kevon Grant Looney,F-C,6-9,220.0,February 6 1996,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",False,/players/l/looneke01.html,10.0,[10],"Kevon Grant Looney (born February 6, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a freshman playing college basketball with the UCLA Bruins, he earned second-team all-conference honors in the Pac-12 in 2014–15. After the season, he decided to forgo his college eligibility and enter the 2015 NBA draft, and was subsequently selected in the first round by Golden State with the 30th overall pick. He won consecutive NBA championships with the Warriors in 2017 and 2018. Growing up in Wisconsin, Looney was named the top high school player in the state as a senior in 2014. He also received national recognition as a five-star prospect and earned All-American honors. In his only season at UCLA, he led all freshmen in the nation in double-doubles, recording double figures in both points and rebounds in 15 games. One of the top players in the Pac-12, he was also named to their all-freshman team. As a rookie with Golden State, Looney's playing time was limited after undergoing surgery on both of his hips. The following season, a strained left hip sidelined him for most of the playoffs during their championship run. Finally healthy in 2017–18, he became a regular in the Warriors' rotation as an undersized center, helping them win a second straight championship. Looney was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Doug and Victoria Looney.As a youngster, he watched his brother Kevin, who was six years older, play pickup games. Like his brother, Looney became a Los Angeles Lakers and Kobe Bryant fan, and would watch tapes of Bryant and copy the Lakers star's moves.Looney was the best player on his high school team at Alexander Hamilton High in Milwaukee.He was already being recruited by colleges as a freshman, receiving offers from in-state schools Marquette and Wisconsin.In his sophomore year in 2012, he was named Player of the Year of the Milwaukee City Conference after averaging 20.9 points, 8.6 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game.As a junior, Looney averaged 26.1 points, 12.4 rebounds, 7.0 blocks and 3.1 assists per game, and led a team of mostly unproven players to a runner-up finish for the conference title.In his final season he averaged 27.9 points, 12.7 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 8.0 blocks per game;both CBS Sports and The Post-Crescent called his averages ""nearly"" a quadruple-double.Though he was Hamilton's tallest player, he was also its best passer, and played mostly at point guard. Capable of handling the ball, creating his own shot, and shooting, mixtapes on YouTube hailed him as ""the next KD"", in reference to future Golden State teammate Kevin Durant. Hamilton went undefeated in conference play to win its first league title in four years, and Looney earned his second City Conference player of the year award. He gained national recognition, becoming just the second player in Milwaukee Public Schools history, and the sixth ever in Wisconsin, to be named a McDonald's All-American; he was a Parade All-American as well. Looney was named Wisconsin Mr. Basketball by the Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association, and Gatorade and the Associated Press named him their state player of the year. He was listed as a five-star prospect by Rivals.com, ESPN.com and Scout.com, who ranked him nationally as the No. 10, No. 12, and No. 15 player, respectively.Hamilton retired Looney's No. 5 in 2018. He had considered changing his number when he was a sophomore, but his close friend Wati Majeed talked him out of it. ""You’re No. 5, that’s who you are. You can play all five positions and guard all five positions,"" said Majeed. Looney announced on Halloween in 2013 his decision to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). No recruiting analysts at 247Sports.com had predicted his decision, which was a secret to everyone including his parents.Looney liked California, and called UCLA the ""most beautiful campus I had ever seen.""He was impressed with Bruins coach Steve Alford's vision for the team. The Bruins did not guarantee Looney a feature role as a freshman, but sold to him that he would be allowed to play both inside and outside and show his versatility, much like Kyle Anderson did for the school in 2013–14.Upon his arrival at UCLA over the summer before his freshman season, Looney suffered a hip injury playing in the gym. Bruins guard Isaac Hamilton shot the ball and fell into the right leg of Looney, who was positioning to rebound the ball. He rested for two-to-three weeks before the season. He did not miss a practice or game all year, but the injury hampered his lateral movement and speed. He avoided changing directions, and played more like a lumbering big man. Playing power forward for the Bruins, he was one of the top freshman in the country in 2014–15. In the season opener, he debuted with 20 points, nine rebounds and three assists in a 113–78 win over Montana State. CBS Sports called his performance ""one of the more impressive freshman debuts in UCLA's rich history.""He followed up with double-doubles in his next four games, and became the first freshman in UCLA history with at least four double-doubles in his first five games. Soon, pundits began projecting Looney as a freshman lottery pick should he decide to enter the National Basketball Association (NBA). He had seven double-doubles in the Bruins' first 10 games, before scoring in double digits just once during a five-game losing streak for UCLA, which included an 0–2 start to their Pac-12 Conference schedule. Looney helped the team end their streak with career highs of 27 points and 19 rebounds in an 86–81 double-overtime win over Stanford. He was one of 14 players named to the midseason watch list of the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) for the Wayman Tisdale Award, presented annually to the nation's top freshman. He was also one of 16 finalists for the inaugural Karl Malone Award, given to the top power forward in Division I men's basketball. UCLA rarely called plays for Looney, and his scoring typically came off putbacks, fast breaks, and open shots. A natural at rebounding, his shooting improved as the season progressed. After making just nine of 28 of his three-point field goals in the first 24 games, Looney was 11 of 17 in the last seven games of the regular season. Still his scoring tapered off, with only one game over 15 points since his career-game at Stanford. In the 2015 Pac-12 Tournament, Looney exited mid-game after he took an arm to his left cheek during UCLA's quarterfinal win over USC. He was a game-time decision to play the following day against Arizona, when he was cleared and fitted with a protective mask just 90 minutes before the contest. Though impaired by the mask, he played 30 minutes but was limited, finishing below his season averages with only five points and four rebounds. The Bruins lost 70–64, but the close match helped them secure a bid into the 2015 NCAA tournament. Looney continued to play wearing the mask as UCLA advanced to the Sweet 16 for the second straight season. For the season, Looney averaged 11.6 points and led the team with 9.2 rebounds per game, finishing with 15 double-doubles. Among all freshmen nationally, his double-doubles led the nation and his rebounding ranked second. His rebounds and double-doubles ranked second among all players in the Pac-12. Looney made 47.0 percent of his field goals, and 41.5 percent from three-point range. He was voted second-team All-Pac-12, and named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team. He was also named second-team all-district by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC). After one season with UCLA, Looney decided to forgo his remaining college eligibility to declare for the 2015 NBA draft. However, his draft stock dropped over concerns with his hip. ESPN.com reported on the morning of the draft that he had undergone surgery on his hip before the 2014–15 season, and stated that ""he probably misses the [following] season."" However, Looney's camp denied he had any procedure done. He had also heard that some teams did not think his success at UCLA would translate to the NBA, and there were executives and scouts that did not believe he played hard enough. One of 19 players who attended the draft, Looney fell to the final pick of the first round, where he was chosen 30th overall by Golden State. The Warriors, who had recently won the 2015 NBA Finals, stated that they had no evidence that Looney required any further treatment. Nonetheless, they were comfortable with any recovery time that he might need, given his age, potential, and the team's established core lineup. On July 8, 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Warriors, and played on their Las Vegas Summer League team. On August 20, Looney underwent a successful right hip arthroscopy to repair a torn labrum. On January 4, 2016, Looney was assigned to the Santa Cruz Warriors, Golden State's D-League affiliate, after he was cleared to practice following rehab from his surgery. He made his professional debut on January 12 with Santa Cruz, logging a double-double with 11 points and 12 rebounds in 16 minutes against the Idaho Stampede. On January 24, he was recalled by Golden State after averaging 8.0 points and 10.0 rebounds in 18.2 minutes over five games. Three days later against the Dallas Mavericks, Looney was activated for the first time due to an injury to big man Festus Ezeli. He made his NBA debut that evening, becoming the 11th former UCLA player to play for the Warriors. Looney scored on his first attempt and finished with two points and two rebounds in a 127–107 win. He was given the game ball after the game. Golden State had him continue working on his conditioning, and he received multiple assignments to Santa Cruz. Looney suffered a setback in March, when he was sidelined by inflammation in his surgically repaired hip. The Warriors finished the regular season with an NBA-record 73 wins, breaking the previous mark of 72 set by the Chicago Bulls in 1995–96. On April 22, Looney underwent a successful arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn labrum on his left hip, which was expected to sideline him from four to six months. A similar procedure had been performed on his right hip eight months earlier. He finished his rookie year with five games played with Golden State and 12 in the D-League. The Warriors made the NBA Finals in 2016, where they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games despite having a 3–1 lead. Looney did not play in the 2016 Summer League while he continued to rehab. Unable to play most of the previous 15 months, he came to training camp overweight. During the preseason, he battled James Michael McAdoo to be the No. 5 forward on the Warriors' depth chart. Looney started the 2016–17 season strongly. On November 26, 2016, he made his first career start in place of an injured Draymond Green. He finished with six points, three rebounds, and two assists in 18 minutes of play in a 115–102 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, Looney grew ineffective in limited minutes, and his playing time diminished. On January 13, 2017, he received a one-game assignment to Santa Cruz after an extended stretch of limited playing time. He was impressive in his D-League season debut, logging 18 points and 20 rebounds in 24 minutes. It was the first of three D-League stints for him during the season. Looney missed most of April due to a left hip strain. Golden State finished the regular season with a league-leading 67 wins and advanced to the NBA Finals, where they defeated Cleveland in five games to win their second championship in three years. Looney was inactive for all 17 playoff games, missing 12 due to his left hip. Healthy at last, Looney became a regular rotation player in 2017–18. He lost 30 pounds (14 kg) prior to the season after hiring a personal trainer over the summer, changing his training program, and adopting a modified Paleo diet. However, he was one of six centers on the team behind starter Zaza Pachulia and veterans David West and JaVale McGee, while youngsters Jordan Bell and Damian Jones appeared to have brighter futures. On October 27, 2017, Looney had nine points on 4-of-4 shooting and five rebounds in a 120–117 win over Washington. Finally able to play extended minutes without being out of breath, he helped lead an 18-point second-half comeback after Green was ejected late in the second quarter. On October 31, Golden State did not exercise their fourth-year option on Looney for 2018–19 due to his contract's luxury tax impact on their payroll, making him an unrestricted free agent the following summer. Nonetheless, he began receiving regular playing time despite not having played in seven of the Warriors' first nine games. Golden State coach Steve Kerr stated that the league was shifting towards a small-ball, switching style of play, and he called Looney ""our best switching [center]"". On November 11, in a 135–114 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, Looney had four points and three blocked shots with a plus-minus of +14 in 15 minutes while matched up mostly opposite Joel Embiid, one of the league's top centers. Looney's playing time in December dropped to seven minutes per game after the rookie Bell passed him on the depth chart. On January 4, 2018, against the Houston Rockets, Looney had seven points and tied his then-career high with eight rebounds in 15 minutes in a 124–114 win. He played the final 6:30 of the game and was more effectively switching defensively on Rockets guard Chris Paul than Bell, who remained on the bench in the second half. After playing minimally and sitting out the last two games, he was praised by Kerr for being an ""amazing example of what being a professional is about in this league."" On January 12, Looney returned to his hometown and played a career-high 23 minutes while scoring nine points on a perfect 3-of-3 shooting with another eight rebounds, three assists and a block in a 108–94 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 17, he had career highs of 13 points and six blocks in a 124–109 win over the Phoenix Suns. On March 27, he grabbed a career-best 11 rebounds off the bench in a 92–81 loss to the Indiana Pacers. Playing in the first postseason of his career, Looney impressed with his defensive switching. The Warriors won the first round of the 2018 playoffs 4–1 over the San Antonio Spurs. McGee was the starting center, but Looney became Kerr's favorite, playing the most (100 minutes) of all the Warriors' big men. Looney guarded LaMarcus Aldridge well, and Kerr praised his defense and ability to switch onto Spurs guards Patty Mills and Manu Ginóbili on pick and rolls. He was steadier than Bell, and former starter Pachulia did not receive any playing time the entire series. Golden State captured the conference semifinals 4–1 over the New Orleans Pelicans. In the series, Looney emerged as the team's most dependable center and defended Anthony Davis adequately. In the final two games, he became the Warriors' sixth man after the team went small and started their Hamptons Five lineup with Green at center. Against the Rockets in the conference finals, Looney provided solid defense against guards Paul and James Harden. He moved into the starting lineup in Game 4 after forward Andre Iguodala was sidelined with a leg contusion. He started the final four games of the series, and the Warriors defeated Houston 4–3 to advance to the Finals for a rematch against Cleveland. The Warriors swept the Cavaliers 4–0 for their second straight championship. Looney started Game 1 before being supplanted in Game 2 by McGee. He played 39 minutes in the four games, but only three minutes in the last two after Iguodala returned. He finished the playoffs playing the sixth most minutes (387) on the Warriors and the most among their six centers. Golden State had a 97.5 defensive rating with him playing, which was the best of all their rotation players. Looney re-signed with the Warriors for 2018–19. Golden State also added four-time NBA All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins with their mid-level exception, but he was rehabbing his left Achilles tendon and had no definitive timeline on when he would return. Looney began the season as a reserve, while Damian Jones was the starting center. However, Jones was ruled out for the season after tearing his left pectoral muscle. On December 3, 2018, in his first start for the injured Jones, Looney scored 14 points along with a career-high-tying five assists in a 128–111 win over the Atlanta Hawks. After starting at center for all except one of the previous 18 games, he returned to the bench when Cousins made his Warriors debut on January 18, 2019. On January 28, Looney scored a career-high 15 points, shooting 6-for-7 off the bench, in a 132–100 win over the Pacers. He ended the regular season averaging career highs in points (6.3), shooting percentage (62.5 percent), rebounds (5.2) and minutes played (18.5). In Game 2 of the Warriors' first-round playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers, following a first-quarter injury to Cousins, Looney scored a career-high 19 points in a 135–131 loss. With Cousins expected to be out for the remainder of the playoffs, Kerr started Andrew Bogut—the former Warrior who was acquired late in the season—to keep Looney in the backup role where he had excelled. The Warriors advanced to the following round against Houston, when Kerr opened the series by starting the Hamptons Five, placing Iguodola into the starting lineup and moving Green to center. Looney assumed Bogut's minutes, as he was a better defensive option against the Rockets as a backup to Green. In Game 5, he had nine rebounds, including five on the offensive end, and a key block late in the game as the Warriors won to go up 3–2 in the series despite losing Kevin Durant to a right calf strain near the end of the third quarter. Kerr called Looney their ""unsung hero tonight"". Golden State advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where Looney excelled for the second straight year. He was their best center in the series, and closed out their sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers with 12 points and a career-high 14 rebounds in Game 4. Kerr lauded him as a ""foundational piece"" of the franchise. In Game 2 of the 2019 Finals against the Raptors, Looney collided with Kawhi Leonard and suffered a non-displaced first costal cartilage fracture, near the collarbone, and was unavailable in Game 3. He was averaging 20.4 minutes per game and shooting 73 percent in the playoffs. While most of his shots were from short distance, he remained an efficient 73 percent (38 of 52) when tightly guarded. Looney returned in Game 4 to play the rest of the series, but the Warriors lost in six games. During the off-season, Looney re-signed with the Warriors on a three-year deal worth $15 million. That summer, he began feeling discomfort in his hamstings. He was sidelined following the 2019–20 season opener after tightness in his hamstring was diagnosed as neuropathy, a disorder resulting from nerve damage outside of the brain and spinal cord. He had managed to play through the condition since his second season in the NBA, often experiencing numbness in his hands, wrist and feet. However, he could no longer deal with the situation once it reached his hamstrings. The 6-foot-9-inch (2.06 m) Looney is most suited to playing power forward. Possessing a 7-foot-4-inch (2.24 m) wingspan, he is also a capable, small-ball center who is able to guard all five positions. His length allows him to switch assignments and defend guards. He moves fairly well on the perimeter, and is not easily lured by pump fakes. He can also defend the rim. Looney had limited mobility after his hip surgeries. Lacking explosion, he worked on faking opponents and getting his defender off balance. After he became healthier and lost weight, he became more athletic and proficient at catching lob passes. During the summer 2018 off-season, he worked on finishing the lobs without having to land first. In addition to brother Kevin, Looney has one older sister, Summer.He is the cousin of Nick Young, who is also an NBA player. They were teammates with the Warriors in 2017–18.",26420,2576,2019-20,16.0,3.0,194.0,3.7,10.4,0.357,0.2,1.5,0.125,3.5,8.9,0.396,1.1,1.7,0.667,4.1,4.6,8.7,2.4,1.7,0.7,1.7,4.8,8.7,10.0,Golden State Warriors

He was selected 10th overall by the Nets in the 2008 NBA draft, after playing two years of college basketball for the Stanford Cardinal. In 2013, Lopez was selected to play in his first NBA All-Star Game. His twin brother Robin Lopez is also an NBA player. Brook Lopez was born in the Los Angeles district of North Hollywood to Deborah Ledford and his now-estranged father, Heriberto Lopez, a native of Cuba. His grandfather played at the University of Colorado. Lopez moved from Hollywood to Oak Harbor, Washington, while in second grade to be near his older brother, Alex, who was playing basketball at the University of Washington at the time. He moved to his current hometown of Fresno, California, a year later, where he attended San Joaquin Memorial High School. While there he played basketball with his twin brother, Robin Lopez, as well as Quincy Pondexter, a fellow future NBA player. Both teammates played with Lopez on their successful AAU team, the Elite Basketball Organization (EBO), along with Derrick Jasper and Tre'Von Willis, both of UNLV. Brook, along with his brother, Robin, committed to Stanford University early in 2005. The Lopez twins were the second twin combination at Stanford, following Jason Collins and Jarron Collins.The 2006–07 season was Lopez's first season at Stanford University. He was an All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention and was named to the All-Pac-10 Freshman Team. He averaged 12.6 points and 6.0 rebounds over the course of his freshman season. The following season, he averaged 19.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 2.1 blocks per game. In the second round of the 2008 NCAA Tournament, Lopez hit the game-winning shot at the buzzer against the Marquette Golden Eagles for an 82–81 overtime victory. He was named to the All-Pac-10 First Team and an All-American Third Team his sophomore season. On March 31, 2008, both Lopez brothers declared for the 2008 NBA draft.Lopez was drafted by the New Jersey Nets 10th overall. His twin brother, Robin, was drafted 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns. Lopez played in his first NBA game on October 29, 2008 in a 95-85 Nets win. In his first game Lopez came off the bench and had 8 points 8 rebounds and 2 blocks in 25 minutes.Lopez began starting for the Nets after an injury took Josh Boone out of the line-up, and afterwards he started putting up solid numbers for the team. Lopez was selected to compete in the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge. For his rookie season Lopez averaged 13.0 points, 8.1 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game, playing in all 82 games of the regular season. He ranked 4th in the NBA in total blocks with 154 and 9th in blocks per game with 1.9, which was first among rookies.He finished third in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting and was named to the All-Rookie first team.He was selected as NBA Rookie of the Month twice in the months of January and February. The Nets finished at 34-48, failing to qualify for the playoffs. The Nets started the 2009–10 season going 0-18, the worst start to a season in NBA history. Because of their start the Nets fired head coach Lawrence Frank.The Nets won their first game on December 4, 2009 against the Charlotte Bobcats 97-91. Lopez contributed in the win with 31 points and 14 rebounds.In his second season, Lopez established career bests in minutes played per game (36.9) and rebounds per game (8.6) while averaging 18.8 points per game. Lopez started in all the Nets' games in the 2009–10 season. Despite his improving play, however, the Nets struggled all season, finishing with one of the worst records in NBA history at 12-70; only 3 more wins than the 1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers.For his third NBA season, Lopez for the third consecutive year played in all 82 regular season games. Lopez struggled rebounding the ball during the season and was criticized by head coach Avery Johnson because of his rebounding. During the season the Nets traded for all-star point guard Deron Williams. The move helped Lopez out significantly, as he saw his scoring average increase. During the season Lopez averaged 20.4 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.5 blocks. The Nets finished at 24-58, once again missing the playoffs. In the preseason of the lockout-shortened 2011–2012 campaign, Lopez broke his right foot and missed the first 32 games of the regular season. In his season debut against the Milwaukee Bucks, Lopez finished with 9 points and 2 boards. In only his third game back, he scored a season high 38 points in a road win over the Dallas Mavericks. Five games after his season debut, he injured his right ankle in a win over the Charlotte Bobcats. Due to the Nets' poor record, they decided to shut down Lopez for the remainder of the 2011–2012 season. In the little time that Lopez played he averaged 19.2 points and a career low in rebounds with 3.6. On July 11, 2012, the Nets re-signed Lopez to a four-year, $61 million contract extension. Lopez got off to a hot start in 2012, scoring 27 points in the season opener against the Toronto Raptors. He followed that performance by scoring 20 or more points in seven of the next twelve games, before injuring his ankle in a win over the Boston Celtics on November 28. The Nets struggled to a 2-5 record without Lopez before he returned on December 14. He began to play well again in late December, posting three straight 20 point, 10 rebound games, including a 35-point, 11 rebound performance in a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on December 29. On January 30, 2013, NBA Commissioner David Stern selected Lopez to play in the 2013 NBA All-Star Game, his first All-Star appearance, replacing Rajon Rondo who had suffered a season-ending ACL injury. In the game, Lopez finished the game with 5 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 points in 11 minutes; all of his points came from the free throw line. On March 20, 2013, the Nets were on the road playing the Dallas Mavericks when Lopez had 38 points and 11 rebounds in a 113-97 Nets win. His 38-point total was only 1 point away from his career high of 39. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Lopez averaged 19.4 points and 6.9 rebounds, as he also set a new career high in blocks with 2.1. At the end of the season, the Nets won 49 games and were the fourth seed in the east. Lopez played all seven of the Nets playoff games, averaging 22.3 points and 7.4 rebounds. The Nets were eliminated in a seven-game, first-round series by the Chicago Bulls. In a season-opening loss at the Cleveland Cavaliers, Lopez scored 21 points and grabbed 5 rebounds. On November 15, 2013, Lopez logged 27 points and 7 rebounds in an overtime win over the Phoenix Suns. On December 7, 2013, Lopez had 32 points and 7 rebounds against the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 20, 2013, the Nets announced Lopez was out for the remainder of the season with a foot injury he had suffered the night before against the Philadelphia 76ers. In the 17 games that Lopez played, he averaged 20.7 points 6 rebounds 56.3% from the field and 81.7% from the free throw line. This was the first season he didn't manage to record at least one double-double. On November 3, 2014, Lopez made his 2014–15 season debut after missing the first two games with a foot injury. In just under 24 minutes of action, he recorded 18 points, 6 rebounds, 2 blocks and 1 steal in the 116-85 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. He went on to miss eight games between December 8 and 21 with a lower back strain, and following his return on December 23 against Denver, Lopez was benched in favor of Mason Plumlee who was the starting center in Lopez' absence. He remained coming off the bench for three more games before starting alongside Plumlee on December 30 against Chicago with Kevin Garnett out resting. He subsequently recorded 29 points, 5 rebounds and 2 blocks in the 96-82 win. On March 20, 2015, Lopez recorded 32 points and a season-high 18 rebounds in a 129-127 triple overtime win over the Milwaukee Bucks.

On March 1, he scored 24 points in a 109–100 win over the Sacramento Kings. It was only Brooklyn's 10th win of the season, as Lopez surpassed 10,000 points with the Nets. He became the second player in Nets history to score 10,000 points—his 10,014 points seeing him sit behind only Buck Williams (10,440) on the franchise list. On March 26 against Atlanta, Lopez became the Nets' career leader in field goals, passing Buck Williams. Lopez got the seven field goals he needed to pass Williams' team record of 3,981. With 25 points against the Boston Celtics on April 10, Lopez passed Williams to become the franchise's career leading scorer.

On November 11, he had a career-high eight 3-pointers and 28 points in a 121–114 win over the Denver Nuggets. After not making a single 3-point shot in his first six NBA seasons, Lopez became a reliable threat from deep, including making at least six 3-pointers in three out of four games for the Bucks between November 6–11. He gained the nickname ""Splash Mountain"", a nod to the Splash Brothers, the prolific 3-point-shooting guards Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors. On January 1, Lopez had 25 points and made 7 of 12 from 3-point range in a 121–98 win over the Detroit Pistons.

He was selected with the 15th pick in the 2008 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns, was traded to the New Orleans Hornets in 2012 and was traded to Portland in 2013. He played college basketball for the Stanford Cardinal alongside his twin brother Brook Lopez, who also currently plays for the Milwaukee Bucks. Lopez was born in North Hollywood, California, to Heriberto Lopez, a Cuban baseball player, and Deborah Ledford, a swimmer.He attended San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno, California, where he was named a McDonald's All-American in 2006. Lopez was one of just three players for the Cardinal team to start all 31 games in the 2006–07 season. He averaged 7.5 points and 5.5 rebounds per game, while averaging 24 minutes.He led the team with 73 blocked shots, breaking the Stanford record for a freshman and recording the second highest single season record in Stanford history. This mark also was the highest in the Pacific-10 conference. With his twin brother, Brook, the two blocked more shots than seven Pac-10 teams.Lopez also had two double-doubles on the season. Lopez had his 100th career block in a game versus Santa Clara University on December 19, 2007. In his sophomore season, Lopez achieved All-Pac-10 Defensive Team honors while also being named an Honorable Mention to the All-Pac-10 team.He was second in the Pac-10 in blocks for the season. With 83 blocks in his second season, Lopez moved into second place all time for career blocks by a Stanford player. Lopez declared that he would enter the 2008 NBA draft on March 31, 2008 after just two seasons at Stanford.Lopez was selected with the 15th overall pick by the Phoenix Suns in the 2008 NBA draft. After being drafted by the Suns, Lopez said: ""I was hoping I'd drop. I think I was the only person in the draft that was hoping he'd drop.""Lopez joined a Suns team already featuring one of the all-time great centers in Shaquille O'Neal, and thus was not expected to get many minutes during his rookie season. He got the first start of his career on November 7, 2008, against the Chicago Bulls in place of the injured O'Neal; he played 30 minutes, scored 14 points, grabbed 7 rebounds and had 2 blocks. For his rookie season, Lopez only saw an average of 10.2 minutes per game, with 3.2 points and 2 rebounds. At the end of the season, Shaq was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, making Lopez the assumed starting center. During the 2009–10 regular season, Lopez averaged 8.4 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.0 block per game. During the end of the season, however, Lopez was injured, and was replaced by Jarron Collins until the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, where the Suns eventually lost, 4 games to 2. After the 2009–10 season, Lopez went into a major decline, despite starting and playing more games. During December 2010, he was injured again, and he was temporarily replaced by Earl Barron. This eventually resulted in decreased production from Lopez, which forced the Suns to trade for Marcin Gortat. While Lopez was still starting for the Suns, his stats were quickly declining, while Gortat's stats were improving. This forced Lopez to eventually become a bench player again. Robin Lopez would average 6.4 points and 3.2 rebounds at an average of 14.8 minutes per game. In the shortened 2011–12 NBA season, Lopez wouldn't even produce a single start for the Suns. Because of Gortat's increased production at center, Lopez was forced to become a back-up center once again. He averaged 5.4 points with an average of 14 minutes per game there. On July 27, 2012, the New Orleans Hornets acquired Lopez in a sign-and-trade from the Phoenix Suns. It was during this time that Lopez would produce his best results yet, starting for every game of the season and gaining new career highs in almost every field in the process. On July 10, 2013, New Orleans traded Lopez to the Portland Trail Blazers as a part of a three-way trade that also involved the Sacramento Kings. In his first season with the Trail Blazers, he recorded 29 double-doubles and set the franchise single season record for offensive rebounds. Due to his presence in the Portland community, as well as his consistent and blue-collar style of play, Lopez was a fan favorite amongst the Portland faithful. He was honored with the Maurice Lucas Award in March 2014 for his efforts in his ""Read Big"" literacy campaign with Portland Public Schools. On December 16, 2014, Lopez was ruled out for a month after breaking his hand against San Antonio the night before. On July 9, 2015, Lopez signed with the New York Knicks. In February 2016, Lopez had two 26-point, 16-rebound games, both season highs. On March 20, 2016, he recorded 23 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in an 88–80 loss to the Sacramento Kings. On June 22, 2016, Lopez was traded, along with José Calderón and Jerian Grant, to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Derrick Rose, Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick. On March 17, 2017, he scored a season-high 25 points in a 112–107 loss to the Washington Wizards.

14521,2586,Kevin Love,Kevin Wesley Love,F,6-8,215.0,September 7 1988,"Santa Monica, California",False,/players/l/loveke01.html,6.0,"[18, 6]","Kevin Wesley Love (born September 7, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is a five-time All-Star and won an NBA championship with the Cavaliers in 2016. He was also a member of the gold medal-winning United States national team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Summer Olympics. The son of former NBA player Stan Love, Love was a top-ranked prospect out of Lake Oswego High School in Oregon. He played one season of college basketball for the UCLA Bruins and led the team to a Final Four appearance in the 2008 NCAA Tournament. Love was named a consensus First Team All-American and was voted player of the year in the Pac-12 Conference. He elected to forego his remaining three years of college eligibility and entered the 2008 NBA draft. He was taken fifth overall by the Memphis Grizzlies, and was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves on draft night for the third overall selection, O. J. Mayo, in an eight-player deal. During the 2010–11 season, Love established the longest streak for consecutive games recording double figures in points and rebounds since the ABA–NBA merger.He was traded to the Cavaliers in 2014. Love was born on September 7, 1988, in Santa Monica, California, the second of three children to Karen and Stan Love.He grew up in Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he was childhood friends and Little League teammates with fellow future NBA star Klay Thompson.Love played basketball from his earliest days;as a child, he would practice his bounce passes with a cardboard box and study tapes of Wes Unseld.His father Stan, a former NBA big man who was an adept shooter, had his son develop his outside shooting and ballhandling skills.Love played high school basketball for the Lake Oswego Lakers.In his sophomore season, he averaged 25.3 points, 15.4 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game, leading the Lakers to the 2005 state championship game, where they lost to Jesuit High School. The following summer, Nike removed him from its Portland Elite Legends AAU team after he chose to participate in the Reebok ABCD Camp against other top recruits. He went on to play for the Southern California All-Stars, helping the team compile a 46–0 record while garnering three MVP awards.In his junior year, he averaged 28 points, 16.1 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game as Lake Oswego returned to the state championship game, this time winning behind Love's 24 points and 9 rebounds. In his senior season, he averaged 33.9 points, 17.0 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. Lake Oswego made their third straight trip to the state championship game, losing in a rematch of the prior year's final to South Medford High School and Love's rival Kyle Singler despite 37 points from Love. At the conclusion of the season, Love was named the Gatorade National Male Athlete of the Year.He was also a first-team Parade All-American. He finished his high school career as the all-time leading scorer in Oregon boys' basketball history with 2,628 points.In July 2006, Love verbally committed to play college basketball at UCLA. He had also considered playing for North Carolina. Before the 2007–08 season, he received permission from Walt Hazzard to wear number 42 for the Bruins even though the school had retired the number for Hazzard in 1996. After arriving at UCLA, Love regularly sought out retired Bruins legends Bill Walton and John Wooden for advice. His decision to play for UCLA brought anger from fans of Oregon, his father's alma mater, where it was expected Love would play.Prior to a game at Oregon, Ducks fans obtained Love's cell phone number and left obscene messages as well as death threats; the fans also subjected Love's family to obscenities and threw garbage at them during the game. This event, along with similar incidents directed at other players, prompted a discussion of whether abuse by college basketball fans is becoming too extreme. In the 2008 Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, the Bruins defeated the USC Trojans, featuring O. J. Mayo, in the semi-finals. Both Mayo and Love were nominated to the All-Pac-10 tournament team. Later, Love guided UCLA to the regular season Pac-10 conference championship, the conference tournament championship, and a No. 1 seed in the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Love helped the Bruins to the Final Four of the tournament, where they lost to the Memphis Tigers, whose season and tournament appearance, in turn, were later vacated. At the end of the 2007–08 regular season, Love was named consensus first-team All-American, Pac-10 Player of the Year, All-Pac-10, and Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. He led the Bruins with 17.5 ppg, 10.6 rpg, and 23 double-doubles. In a press conference on April 17, 2008, Love announced his intention to leave UCLA to enter the 2008 NBA draft. He was taken fifth overall by the Memphis Grizzlies, immediately after his teammate at UCLA, Russell Westbrook, who was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics. Following the draft, Love was traded, along with Mike Miller, Brian Cardinal, and Jason Collins to the Minnesota Timberwolves, with the third overall pick O. J. Mayo, Antoine Walker, Marko Jarić and Greg Buckner going to the Grizzlies. Love went on to play in the 2008 NBA Summer League and led all players in rebounding. In his NBA debut on October 29, Love came off the bench to contribute 12 points and nine rebounds in a 98–96 win over the Sacramento Kings. The Timberwolves lost 15 of their first 19 games, prompting the dismissal of head coach Randy Wittman. Timberwolves general manager Kevin McHale assumed duties as head coach and they developed a close relationship. Under McHale, the Timberwolves improved their play in January by going 10–4, with Love averaging a double-double. Love was not selected to the NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge, to the surprise of his teammates and coaches. After the team's leading scorer Al Jefferson was sidelined for the rest of the season with a torn ACL in February, Love's minutes increased, and he was named NBA Rookie of the Month for March. Love finished the season ninth in the league in rebounding, first among rookies, and ranked third in total offensive rebounds. Love also led all first-years with 29 double-doubles, the most by a Timberwolves rookie in franchise history. He also ranked first in the league in offensive rebound percentage, becoming the first rookie to lead the league since Hakeem Olajuwon in 1984–85. Love was named to the 2009 NBA All-Rookie Second Team and finished sixth in Rookie of the Year voting. In the off-season, Love was invited to participate in the USA National Team mini-camp that was conducted from July 22 to 25 in Las Vegas. Love also generated attention from his Twitter account when he broke the story that Kevin McHale would not return to coach the Timberwolves for the 2009–2010 season. Love began the season on the injured list when, in a pre-season game on October 16, 2009 against the Chicago Bulls, he broke the fourth metacarpal in his left hand by banging it against the elbow of teammate Oleksiy Pecherov. Following surgery, Love missed the first 18 games of the season. He returned against the New Orleans Hornets on December 4, 2009, and made immediate impact for the Timberwolves, who were struggling out of the gate with a 2–16 record. Love was selected to play in NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge. He finished the season ranked as the NBA's best rebounder per 48 minutes (18.4), besting Dwight Howard (18.3) and Marcus Camby (18.1). Three-point shots accounted for 16 percent of Love's overall field goal attempts, an increase over his rookie rate of 3 percent.The Timberwolves' trade of Jefferson before the 2010–11 NBA season was expected to result in more playing time for Love. However, he averaged 28 minutes through the first nine games, exceeding 30 minutes only twice. Chris Mannix of SI.com wrote that many speculated there was a rift between coach Kurt Rambis and Love. In a home game against the New York Knicks on November 12, 2010, Love became the 19th player to record a ""30–30"" game, when he recorded 31 points along with a career-high 31 rebounds. His 31 rebounds set a Timberwolves franchise record and were also the most by a player in an NBA game since Charles Barkley recorded 33 rebounds in a game in 1996. Love became the first player to record a 30–30 game since Moses Malone in 1982. Love scored a career-high 43 points and had 17 rebounds on December 18 in a 115–113 loss to the Denver Nuggets. On February 4, 2011, Love was selected by Commissioner David Stern to his first NBA All-Star Game as replacement for the injured Yao Ming. The day before, Love was not selected as an All-Star as a reserve although averaging 21.4 points, a league-best 15.5 rebounds, shooting 43.9 percent from 3-point range, and having 34 straight double-doubles for the 11–37 Timberwolves. On February 8, Love set a team record (previously held by Kevin Garnett) with his 38th consecutive double-double after scoring 20 points and recording 14 rebounds in the Timberwolves' 112–108 win over the Houston Rockets. He scored 37 points and had 23 rebounds on February 27 in a 126–123 win over the Golden State Warriors. It was his fourth 30-point, 20-rebound game of the season, and Love went 18 for 23 from the free throw line to tie Minnesota's team records for made and attempted free throws. On March 13, Love's consecutive double-double streak ended at 53 games in a loss to the Golden State Warriors. It was the longest streak since the ABA–NBA merger in 1976,surpassing Malone's 51-game streak from 1979 to 1980. Love was two short of Elvin Hayes's streak of 55 consecutive double-doubles set in the 1973–74 season. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wilt Chamberlain holds the record with 227 consecutive double-doubles from 1964 to 1967. The NBA does not recognize the double-double as an official statistic. Love suffered a strained left groin on March 20 against Sacramento. He missed the final six games and nine of the last 11 games of the season due to the injury. Love led the NBA in rebounding averaging 15.2 per game. He won the NBA Most Improved Player Award after increasing his points per game by 44 percent and his rebounds per game by 38 percent over his previous season. Love established career highs in rebounding, scoring (20.2), assists (2.5), double-doubles (64), field goal percentage (.470), free throw shooting (.850), 3-point shooting (.417) and minutes played (35.8). He became the first player to average at least 20 points and 15 rebounds in a season since Malone in the 1982–83 season. He emerged as the new face of the franchise since Garnett was traded from the Timberwolves to the Boston Celtics in 2007. In 2010–11, Love's No. 42 was the Wolves' top-selling jersey; sales were comparable to Kevin Garnett's when he was in his prime. This was Love's contract season. He had stated that he wanted to be the Timberwolves' ""designated player"" for a five-year deal  during the offseason (a designated player offer must be made prior to the final year qualifying offer), but he was denied this contract by the Timberwolves. Contract negotiations became tense, leading to an incident where David Kahn (team GM) ""marched"" into the players training room and ""thrust  a contract offer sheet into his hands"". Love responded, ""I'm not the one to always follow professional protocol – but I do know what it is, even at 24 years old"". They eventually settled on four years with a player option for Love to opt out after the third year. The four-year contract extension worth up to $62 million was finally agreed to, and signed, on January 25, allowing Love to become an unrestricted free agent as early as 2015. Love has stated that he felt very strongly that he should have had a five-year designated player extension, and would have accepted the offer, had it been offered to him. Love followed up this new contract extension the subsequent night with a 31-point performance in a win over the Dallas Mavericks. In January 2012, Love scored 30 points in three consecutive games for the first time in his career. He began the season recording 15 straight double-doubles, the first player to do so since Hakeem Olajuwon in the beginning of the 1992–93 NBA season. On January 20, Love made a three-point buzzer beater to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers. On February 6, Love was given a two-game suspension for stepping on the face of Houston's Luis Scola. After the February 4 game, Love had said, ""I mean, he fell down after the play. He just kind of laid there and... I just happened to be there. I had nowhere to go. I got kind of tripped up and I just had nowhere to step. He was right there... and it happened to be his face."" On February 25, Love participated in the Three-Point Shootout and defeated Kevin Durant in the final tie-breaking round to win the contest. Love scored a season high 42 points in a win over the Portland Trail Blazers on March 3. Love set a franchise record for most games scoring over 30 points in a season on March 12 in a victory over the Phoenix Suns. He also had a career-high 51 points in a 149–140 double overtime loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The following game, Love erupted for 30 points and grabbed 21 rebounds in a win over the Denver Nuggets. For the season, Love was named to the All-NBA second team and finished sixth in MVP voting. In the offseason, Love voiced frustration with Minnesota for not being a playoff team. The Timberwolves finished with the Western Conference's fourth-worst record at 26–40, which was still the franchise's most wins since the 2006–07 season. On October 17, 2012, it was reported that Love would miss six to eight weeks after breaking the third and fourth metacarpals on his right (shooting) hand during a morning workout. Love surprised fans by returning to the Wolves on November 21, just five weeks after sustaining the injury. He played 35 minutes and scored 34 points while grabbing 14 rebounds against the Denver Nuggets. In December, Love would score 36 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers, yet he continued to voice his frustration with the team's front office. On January 3, 2013, Love refractured his shooting hand in a game against the Denver Nuggets. It was announced by the Timberwolves that Love's injury would require surgery and he was expected to miss an additional eight to ten weeks of playing time. Prior to the second fracture, Love was shooting just 21.7 percent on three-pointers and a career-low 35 percent from the field, leading some to speculate that he had returned too quickly from his original injury. Love himself admitted that the hand remained an issue throughout the season, saying ""It's just the hand being so idle, having to strengthen it. Getting the ball to feel right in my hand has been such a struggle since getting back on the court a couple weeks ago.""  On February 22, 2014, Love recorded his first career triple double with 37 points, 12 rebounds, and a career-high 10 assists in a 121-104 win over the Utah Jazz. On March 9, Love, with a 3-pointer midway through the third quarter of Minnesota's 104-111 loss to the Raptors, broke the Timberwolves’ franchise record for 3-pointers in a season. With that make (143), he passed Rashad McCants' record of 142 in the 2007–08 season. On March 28, he recorded his second career triple double with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 143-107 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. On April 2, 2014, Love recorded his third career triple double with 24 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists in a 102-88 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. Love set an NBA record in 2013–14, becoming the first player in NBA history to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 100 3-pointers in a single season. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the second time in his career. On August 23, 2014, the Timberwolves traded Love to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team trade. The Timberwolves received Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett from Cleveland, and Thaddeus Young from the Philadelphia 76ers, while the Philadelphia 76ers received Luc Mbah a Moute and Alexey Shved from Minnesota and a 2015 first-round draft pick from Cleveland. On February 8, 2015, Love scored a season-high 32 points on 11-of-18 shooting in a 120–105 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. On February 24, he scored 24 points on eight three-pointers, tying his career best, as he helped the Cavaliers defeat the Detroit Pistons, 102–93. Love helped the Cavaliers win 34 of their final 43 games to finish the regular season as the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference with a 53–29 overall record. In his first career playoff game on April 19, Love recorded 19 points and 12 rebounds in a 113–100 win over the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of their first-round playoff match-up. Cleveland swept the series 4–0, but Love missed the remainder of the playoffs after he dislocated his left shoulder in the first quarter of Game 4 when he got tangled with the Celtics' Kelly Olynyk while battling for a loose ball. Love called it a ""bush-league play"", while Olynyk said he would ""never intentionally hurt someone."" The league ruled that Olynyk had ""yanked Love's arm down"", and suspended Olynyk for one game. Love underwent surgery to repair his shoulder and the team said he would need four to six months to recover. Without Love, the Cavaliers reached the 2015 NBA Finals but were defeated by the Golden State Warriors in six games. On June 24, 2015, Love opted out of the final year of his contract, worth $16.7 million in 2015–16, to return to free agency. On July 9, 2015, Love re-signed with the Cavaliers. On November 23, 2015, he scored 27 of his season-high 34 points in the first half of the Cavaliers' 117–103 win over the Orlando Magic. On January 29, 2016, he had his best game since November 23, scoring 29 points on 9-of-19 shooting in a 114–106 win over the Detroit Pistons. That game also marked the first time all season that Love, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving each reached 20 points in a game. The Cavaliers finished the regular season as the first seed in the Eastern Conference with a 57–25 record. In the first round of the playoffs, the Cavaliers faced the eighth-seeded Detroit Pistons, and in a Game 1 win on April 17, Love recorded playoff career highs with 28 points and 13 rebounds. Love helped the Cavaliers advance through to the Eastern Conference Finals where they faced the Toronto Raptors. He struggled in Games 3 and 4 of the series, scoring just 15 total points, before bouncing back in Games 5 and 6 to help the Cavaliers defeat the Raptors 4–2. The win advanced them through to the NBA Finals, where they faced the defending champion Golden State Warriors. Love's struggles in the NBA Finals were well documented. After recording 17 points and 13 rebounds in a Game 1 loss, a concussion suffered in Game 2 forced him to miss Game 3. His return in Game 4 saw him come off the bench to score 11 points, but with a 108–97 loss, the Cavaliers fell behind 3–1 in the series. Game 5 saw Love return to the starting line-up, but despite playing 33 minutes, he managed just two points as the Cavaliers forced a Game 6 with a 112–97 win. Game 6 also saw Love struggle, but the Cavaliers managed a 115–101 win to force a Game 7. The Cavaliers won Games 5 and 6 with Love contributing just nine total points on 2-of-8 shooting. With the series tied a 3–3, Love managed 9 points and 14 rebounds in Game 7 to help the Cavaliers win the series 4–3, as they became the first team to rally from a 3–1 finals deficit, beating the Warriors 93–89 in Game 7 to end a 52-year major sports championship drought in Cleveland. On October 25, 2016, after receiving his first championship ring before the season opener, Love recorded 23 points and 12 rebounds in a 117–88 win over the New York Knicks. On November 3, he scored a then season-high 26 points in a 128–122 win over the Boston Celtics, helping the Cavaliers go 5–0 for the first time since 1976–77 when they started 8–0. On November 23, he scored 40 points, including an NBA-record 34 in the first quarter, to help the Cavaliers defeat the Portland Trail Blazers 137–125. His 34 first-quarter points were the second most all-time in a quarter; Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors set the record at 37 in the third quarter on January 23, 2015. Five days later, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, November 21 through Sunday, November 27. Love led the Cavaliers to a 3–0 week behind an East-leading 30.7 points per game. On December 25, he scored 20 points in 109–108 win over the Warriors, recording his 10,000th career point in the process. On January 26, 2017, Love was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. However, on February 14, 2017, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove a loose body from his left knee, and was subsequently ruled out for approximately six weeks, thus missing the All-Star Game. On March 16, he played his first game for the Cavaliers since February 11 and had 10 points and nine rebounds in 19 minutes in a 91–83 win over the Utah Jazz. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics on May 17, Love scored a playoff career-high 32 points and had 12 rebounds to help the Cavaliers improve to 9–0 in the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Celtics 117–104. With 15 points in Game 5 of the series, Love helped the Cavaliers defeat the Celtics 135–102 to claim their third straight Eastern Conference title and a return trip to the NBA Finals. After going down 3–0 in the 2017 NBA Finals, Love made six 3-pointers and had 23 points in Game 4 to help Cleveland extend the series and avoid a sweep with a 137–116 win over the Warriors. The Cavaliers went on to lose to the Warriors in Game 5, thus losing the series 4–1. In the Cavaliers' season opener on October 17, 2017, Love scored 15 points in a 102–99 win over the Boston Celtics. He hit a critical 3-pointer with 46.3 seconds left to put Cleveland up 102–98. On November 7, 2017, he had a then season-best game with 32 points and 16 rebounds in a 124–119 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.

In Game 2 of the Cavaliers' second-round playoff series against the Raptors, Love had his best game of the postseason with 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 128–110 win, helping Cleveland take a 2–0 lead in the series. Love missed matching his career playoff high by one point. In Game 4 against Toronto, Love scored 23 points in a 128–93 series-clinching win. During the game, Love became the fourth player in Cleveland history with 500 career playoff rebounds, joining LeBron James, Tristan Thompson and Zydrunas Ilgauskas. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, Love recorded 21 points and 13 rebounds in a 124–114 overtime loss to the Warriors. The Cavaliers went on to lose the series in four games. In the aftermath of LeBron James' departure in free agency to the Los Angeles Lakers, the Cavaliers aggressively pushed to secure Love for the long term. On July 24, 2018, Love signed a four-year, $120 million extension with the Cavaliers. He appeared in the first four games of the regular season before being sidelined with an injured left foot. On November 2, Love had surgery to rectify a painful big toe injury on his left foot. The injury had bothered him since the preseason opener and affected his ability to walk. He was initially ruled out for six weeks, but that was later pushed back to the new year. Love returned to action on February 8, 2019, after missing 50 games. He started and played the first six minutes against the Washington Wizards, scoring four points, before not returning to the game. On February 23, he scored a season-high 32 points in a 112–107 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.

In March 2018, Love revealed–in response to DeMar DeRozan's public discussion of his struggles with depression–that he had been seeing a therapist for several months following a panic attack during a game in November 2017. He wrote of ""creating a better environment for talking about mental health"" and the need to remember that ""Everyone is going through something that we can't see."" In August 2018, Love continued his advocacy for mental health awareness, discussing his family's history of depression, along with his own struggles with anxiety, rage, and ""dark times"" where he would hide in his room and not talk to anyone. Love says he's now committed to forming a foundation focusing on mental health, particularly for young boys, adding that he believes he's ""found [his] life's work.""

In his second season with the Raptors, he helped them reach the playoffs for the first time in seven years and win an Atlantic Division title during the 2013–14 season.In 2015–16, he led the Raptors to 56 wins in what was then the highest win total in franchise history, as well as helped the team make the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time. Lowry attended Cardinal Dougherty High School in Philadelphia and played point guard for the school's varsity basketball team. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, he was listed as the No. 6 point guard and the No. 28 player in the U.S. in 2004.In his freshman season at Villanova, Lowry was named to the Big East All-Rookie team and was tabbed Philadelphia Big Five Rookie of the Year. In 24 games (3 starts), he averaged 7.5 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.3 steals per game.In his sophomore season, he was named to the All Big East Second Team, as well as the First Team All-Big 5. In 33 games (31 starts), he averaged 11.0 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game.Lowry was selected by the Memphis Grizzlies with the 24th overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft. He appeared in 10 games as a rookie before suffering a broken wrist against the Cleveland Cavaliers on November 21, 2006.He subsequently underwent season-ending surgery.He returned for the 2007–08 season and appeared in all 82 games for the Grizzlies.The 2008–09 season saw Lowry and good friend Mike Conley Jr. compete for playing time and the starting point guard position. In January 2009, Lionel Hollins was named the team's head coach and Lowry was told that the team would devote the starter's minutes to Conley. Lowry was unhappy with his role, and some in the organization considered him a bad influence on the roster.On February 19, 2009, Lowry was traded to the Houston Rockets in a three-team deal involving the Grizzlies and the Orlando Magic. In Houston, Lowry grew to appreciate the tutelage of his new coach, Rick Adelman.With the Rockets making the playoffs in 2009, Lowry played in the post-season for the first time in his career. In 2009–10, Lowry served as the backup point guard to Aaron Brooks. On December 18, 2009, he recorded a career-high 26 points, 10 assists, six rebounds, and five steals in a 116–108 win over the Dallas Mavericks. On June 30, 2010, Lowry signed a qualifying offer with the Rockets and became a restricted free agent. On July 13, 2010, he signed an offer sheet with the Cleveland Cavaliers worth $23.5 million over four years. The Rockets quickly matched the offer, thus retaining Lowry. In 2010–11, Lowry started in 71 of the 75 games he played in, and his reputation in the league began to solidify.On December 3, he scored a career-high 28 points and matched his career best with 12 assists in the Rockets' 127–111 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. On December 17, in another win over the Grizzlies, Lowry recorded 17 points and a career-high 18 assists. On January 14, he matched his season high with 28 points in a 110–105 overtime loss to the New Orleans Hornets. On February 16, he scored a career-high 36 points in a 114–105 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 8, he scored 32 points and made a career-high seven 3-pointers in a 113–110 loss to the Phoenix Suns. On March 20, he recorded his first career triple-double with 28 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 110–108 win over the Utah Jazz, becoming only the fourth Rockets player since 2002–03 to record a triple-double. He was subsequently named Western Conference Player of the Week. With the departure of Adelman following the 2010–11 season, Lowry initially clashed with new head coach Kevin McHale.In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Lowry appeared in 47 games with 38 starts, missing 15 games over March and April with a bacterial infection that required hospitalization. With Lowry out, backup point guard Goran Dragić played well in his absence, and the Rockets decided they could trade Lowry to shed their salary cap and acquire draft picks during the offseason.On July 11, 2012, Lowry was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Gary Forbes and a future first round pick. Lowry averaged over 23 points and seven assists through the first three games of the season, but was injured during the team's fourth game, a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on November 6, 2012. Upon his return he came off the bench behind José Calderón, but regained the starting position when Calderón was traded in a three-team deal on January 30, 2013 that brought Memphis Grizzlies small forward Rudy Gay to the Raptors. Despite the trade, which was meant to help the struggling Raptors return to relevance, the team finished the season with a 34-48 record, missing the playoffs. On May 31, 2013, Masai Ujiri was hired as the Raptors' new general manager, replacing Bryan Colangelo. Ujiri believed that Lowry had the potential to be a star, but found that his reputation around the NBA had more to do with his history of clashing with coaches and his body language than his talent. Ujiri challenged Lowry during meetings that off-season to be a better player and leader. ""Do you want to be a $3 million player, $2 million player for the rest of your career"", Ujiri remembers asking Lowry, ""...or do you want to be a $10 million player or more?"" Lowry also received mentorship from Chauncey Billups, who Lowry remembers ""pushed me mentally to challenge myself."" Receptive to the advice he had received from Ujiri and others, Lowry looked forward to the upcoming season, entering training camp healthy for the first time in several seasons.The Raptors started the 2013–14 season with a 6-12 record, until Gay, the team's leading scorer, was traded to the Sacramento Kings. Following the trade, Raptors shooting guard DeMar DeRozan approached Lowry and the two decided to take ownership of the team, knowing they could both be traded if the team's management decided to rebuild rather than compete for a playoff spot.Lowry's name was linked to several teams, most frequently the New York Knicks, in trade rumors, but the Knicks were reportedly unwilling to send a first-round pick to Toronto in exchange for Lowry.The post-Gay Raptors quickly emerged as one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference, and many cited Lowry's strong play and leadership as a significant factor in their success. The team finished the season with a franchise-best 48-34 record, third in the Eastern Conference and first in the Atlantic Division for the second time in franchise history. They made the playoffs for the first time since 2008, but lost in the first round to the Brooklyn Nets after Lowry's potential game-winning shot was blocked by Paul Pierce in Game 7. Despite the disappointing end to the season, Lowry averaged a career-best 17.9 points, 7.4 assists, and 4.7 rebounds during the regular season and 21.1 points, 4.7 assists, and 4.7 rebounds during the playoffs. Lowry entered the off-season as one of the NBA's most coveted free agents, attracting interest from the Miami Heat, Houston Rockets, and other teams. On July 10, 2014, he re-signed with the Raptors to a four-year, $48 million contract. The Raptors and Lowry continued their strong play into the next season, and the team once again emerged as a top seed in the Eastern Conference. On November 7, 2014, Lowry became the team's all-time leader for triple-doubles with a 13-point, 10 assist, and 11 rebound performance in a win against the Washington Wizards. It was Lowry's sixth career triple-double and his fourth as a Raptor, passing Damon Stoudamire, who had the previous franchise record of three. On December 3, he scored a career-high 39 points on 13-of-22 shooting in a win against the Utah Jazz. On January 5, 2015, Lowry was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for December 2014, making him only the second Raptor, after Chris Bosh, to receive this recognition. Lowry averaged 22.3 points, 8.9 assists, and 4.2 rebounds during the month, winning Player of the Week during the first week and helping lead the Raptors to an 11-4 record. On January 22, 2015, Lowry became a first-time All-Star when he was announced as an Eastern Conference starter in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game. He became only the third Raptor to be voted in as a starter, after Vince Carter and Bosh. On February 5, 2015, the NBA announced that Lowry would also participate in the 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge as part of the NBA All-Star Weekend. Lowry finished the All-Star game with 10 points, a team-high eight assists, three rebounds and four steals in a loss to the West, completing his first in-game dunk since 2009. On March 16, 2015, Lowry recorded his seventh career triple-double with 20 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 117-98 win over the Indiana Pacers. The Raptors finished the 2014–15 season with a franchise-best 49-33 record, fourth in the East and first in the Atlantic, but were swept in the first round by the Washington Wizards, despite entering the series with homecourt advantage. Lowry averaged 17.8 points, 6.8 assists and 4.7 rebounds in 70 games during the regular season, but a disappointing 12.3 points, as well as 4.8 assists, and 5.5 rebounds, in the playoffs, with many questioning his health during the series. Following his disappointing performance in the playoffs, Lowry entered the 2015–16 season with a noticeably slimmer physique, looking ""as trim and fit as he ever has during his nearly decade-long NBA career"", according to Toronto Sun writer, Ryan Wolstat. Lowry explained that he wanted to be prepared ""for 82 games and a long playoff run."" On November 3, he scored a game-high 27 points against the Dallas Mavericks as the Raptors started 4–0 for the first time in franchise history (the streak eventually ended with five wins). On December 5, Lowry scored a then career-high 41 points and made six three-pointers in a loss to the Golden State Warriors. On January 18, 2016, Lowry tied his career-high of made three-pointers in game with seven, scoring a game-high 31 points in total, in a 112–100 win over the Brooklyn Nets. On January 21, he was named as a starter to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game. He was also later named a contestant in the Three-Point Contest, making him the third Raptors player to participate in this event. On February 1, in a 112–93 loss to the Denver Nuggets, Lowry passed Alvin Williams for second all-time on the Raptors' assists list. The following day, Lowry and teammate DeMar DeRozan were selected as co-winners for Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January. The pair helped the Raptors go 12–2 during the month and record a franchise-record 11-game win streak. On February 14, Lowry finished his second All-Star game, held in Toronto for the first time, with 14 points, 10 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals in the East's 196–173 loss to the West. On February 22, he recorded his eighth career triple-double (sixth as a Raptor) with 22 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds in a 122–95 win over the New York Knicks. Four days later, he scored a career-high 43 points, on 15-of-20 shooting, and had nine assists, five rebounds, and four steals in a 99–97 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. On February 29, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played from February 22–28. On March 21, he was again named Eastern Conference Player of the Week, for games played from March 14–20, becoming the first Raptors player since Chris Bosh in 2009–10 to win the award multiple times in the same season. On March 30, he recorded 17 points, 11 assists, and six rebounds in a 105–97 win over the Atlanta Hawks, helping the Raptors reach 50 wins for the first time in franchise history. The team finished the regular season with a 56–26 record, good for first in the Atlantic Division for the third consecutive year, and second in the Eastern Conference. Lowry entered the playoffs suffering from bursitis in his shooting elbow, as he shot a mere 32% from the field over the final 10 games of the regular season. His poor shooting continued into the postseason as the Raptors faced the Indiana Pacers in the first round. Despite Lowry's struggles, the Raptors defeated the Pacers in seven games, winning their second playoff series in franchise history, their first since 2001, and their first seven-game series. In Game 3 of the Raptors' second-round series against the Miami Heat, Lowry broke out of his shooting slump with a 33-point performance on 11-of-19 shooting, helping the Raptors win 95–91 and go up 2–1 on the series. In Game 6 of the series, he tied his playoff career high with 36 points on 12-of-27 shooting in a 103–91 loss, as the Heat forced a Game 7 in Toronto. In Game 7 of the series, he scored 35 points on 11-of-20 shooting, to go along with nine assists, seven rebounds, and four steals, in a 116–89 win, helping the Raptors advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history. In Game 4 of the Conference Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Lowry scored 35 points on 14-of-20 shooting to help the Raptors win 105–99 and tie the series at 2–2. In Game 6 of the series, Lowry again scored 35 points, but was unable to force a Game 7, with the 113–87 loss knocking the Raptors out of the playoffs with a 4–2 defeat. Lowry capped off his strong season by earning All-NBA third team honors. With his first selection to the All-NBA team, he joined Vince Carter and Chris Bosh as the only players in franchise history to receive this recognition. On November 28, 2016, Lowry set a franchise record by hitting all six of his three-pointers for a game-high 24 points in a 122–95 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 9, he scored 21 of his then season-high 34 points in the second half of the Raptors' 101–94 win over the Boston Celtics.

On January 1, 2017, he scored 20 of his season-high 41 points in the fourth quarter of the Raptors' 123–114 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.

On February 5, 2017, he recorded his ninth career triple-double with 15 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 103–95 win over the Brooklyn Nets. The following day in the Raptors' 118–109 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, Lowry became the Raptors' franchise leader in three-pointers when he buried one from beyond the arc with 5:27 to play in the first half. His third three-pointer of the night gave him 802 in a Toronto uniform, surpassing Morris Peterson's mark. On April 5, 2017, he returned from an 18-game absence with a wrist injury, played 42 minutes, and had 27 points and 10 assists to help the Raptors overcome a 20-point first-half deficit in a 105–102 victory over the Detroit Pistons. In the Raptors' second-round playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Lowry sprained his left ankle in the third quarter of Game 2 and aggravated the injury while trying to warm up for Game 3. He was not active for Game 4 and thus could not assist the Raptors in trying to avoid a series sweep; with a 109–102 loss to the Cavaliers in Game 4, the Raptors bowed out of the playoffs with a 4–0 defeat. Following the playoffs, Lowry declined his $12 million player option for the 2017–18 season and became an unrestricted free agent. On July 7, 2017, Lowry re-signed with the Raptors to a three-year, $100 million contract. On October 27, 2017, he recorded his first triple-double of the season and his eighth as a Raptor with 11 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds in a 101–92 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.

On December 23, 2019, Lowry was named Eastern Conference Player of the week for games played between December 16–22. Lowry was a member of the U.S. men's national team that won gold at the 2016 Summer Olympics, during which he averaged 5 points and 3.3 rebounds. His best scoring performance was in the semifinal game against Spain with 9 points. He earned praise for his defense and leadership during the tournament, with head coach Mike Krzyzewski calling him the team's ""unsung hero"" and assistant coach Jim Boeheim naming him ""the best team player out of everybody."" Lowry's tenacious playing style has often earned him comparisons to a pit bull or bulldog, with many citing his toughness, leadership, and instinct for winning plays on the court. Lowry's Villanova teammate Curtis Sumpter remembers ""he was just so tough. He wasn’t the flashy guy. He wasn’t coming down to try and throw 150 crossovers and make all these fantastic moves. That wasn’t his game. He was just so solid and able to read the defenses and make the pass at the right time and get guys in the right position to score.""In 2014, Zach Lowe of Grantland wrote that Lowry ""was probably the best point guard in the Eastern Conference from start to finish [of the 2013–14 season], raining off-the-bounce 3s, getting Toronto into its offense, toning down the wild gambles on defense, and using that stubby little body to draw more charges than anyone."" Lowry is considered a strong rebounder for his position, as well as an elite defender. He holds the Toronto Raptors' franchise record for triple-doubles, as well as the most made three-point field goals in a season, for the 2013–14 season. Kyle Lowry was born and raised in North Philadelphia. He is married to Ayahna Cornish, a fellow Philadelphian native.

Mahinmi was born to a Beninesefather who helped other Africans immigrate to France and a Jamaicanmother who taught in a preschool. Mahinmi preferred playing soccer as a child along with his older brother, but eventually switched to playing basketball. He was 6 feet tall when he was 14 years old. Mahinmi made his impression on international scouts at the 2004 Under-18 European Championships in Zaragoza, Spain. It was there that he first caught the attention of international scouts, including San Antonio Spurs scout Sam Presti. After playing with the French national team he signed his first contract with the club STB Le Havre (France). He played three seasons with Le Havre, averaging 9.7 points and 5.2 rebounds per game in 2005–06.In the summer of 2006, he signed a contract to play for Pau Orthez in France's top professional league. He averaged 4.3 points and 3.2 rebounds in 12.7 minutes in the 2006–07 season, helping the team win the French Cup. Mahinmi was selected 28th overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the San Antonio Spurs, which surprised many other teams and league officials because he wasn't among the 128 players listed in the league's draft guide. Mahinmi was considered a ""project"" that would be a couple of years from competing in the NBA. The Spurs' interest in Mahinmi related to their need for an athletic big man since David Robinson retired. Playing for the Spurs' 2006 summer-league team at Rocky Mountain Revue, Mahinmi demonstrated his athleticism, but had difficulty maintaining rebounding or post position without fouling. After Mahinmi moved to Pau Orthez, which had a more developed strength and nutrition program than the one at Le Havre, the Spurs also began to send a strength coach to monitor his progress.During the 2007 Summer League, Mahinmi tore his right pectoralis minor shortly after the start of play. Despite this setback, he was signed by the Spurs on August 23, 2007.On October 30, 2007, Mahinmi made his NBA debut with the Spurs against the Portland Trail Blazers, playing only 74 seconds and registering no statistics.Mahinmi played for the Austin Toros, the Spurs' affiliate in the NBA Development League, by November.Mahinmi averaged 17.1 points and 8.2 rebounds in the NBA Development League, leading the Austin Toros to the D-League Finals in which they lost.Mahinmi signed with the Dallas Mavericks on July 13, 2010.On December 7, 2010, against the Golden State Warriors, Mahinmi recorded his first career double-double (12 points and 10 rebounds in 21 minutes).

On March 20, 2011, Mahinmi collected a career-high 13 rebounds and 9 points after playing 20 minutes in the 101-73 win over the Golden State Warriors. On June 12, 2011, in game 6 of the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat with Dallas leading the series 3–2, Mahinmi collected a crucial offensive rebound in the closing seconds of the 3rd quarter before hitting a buzzer beater shot to further extend the Mavericks lead. Dallas went on to win the game 105–95 and Mahinmi won his first NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Mahinmi played four games for STB Le Havre. In December 2011, he returned to the Mavericks. He scored a career high 19 points on December 30, 2011, in a game against the Toronto Raptors as the Mavericks won their first game of the 2011–12 season. Mahinmi went 6-6 from the floor and 7-11 from the free throw line while collecting 5 rebounds. Mahinmi recorded his first career start in a 95-86 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

In his 2014-15 year with the Indiana Pacers, Ian recorded the lowest free throw percentage in the history of the NBA, with a percentage of 30.49%. As a result, Mahinmi almost never played in the fourth quarter as teams would intentionally foul him to get extra possessions and limiting the Pacers’ Offensive rating.

In Game 4 of the Pacers' 2016 first-round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors, Mahinmi scored a career-high 22 points, while his 10 rebounds and five assists were both playoff career bests, as he helped the Pacers tie the series at 2–2 with a 100–83 win.

He attended high school at Orangeville District Secondary School and played basketball for Canada's Athlete Institute. Coming out of high school, Maker was considered a five-star recruit by most basketball recruiting services.Maker was born in Wau,a city located in what is now South Sudan. His uncle, a local administrator, arranged for Maker, his younger brother, Matur, and his aunt to escape the civil war to Uganda. From there, they were accepted as refugees by Australia; they then moved to Perth, Western Australia when Maker was five years of ageand the family eventually settled down.When he was 14, Maker was discovered playing soccer in the Perth suburb of Mirrabooka, by Edward Smith, an Australian of African-American heritage who helps children from migrant backgrounds receive opportunities they otherwise wouldn't get. Smith had previously helped fellow Sudanese immigrants Ater Majok and Mathiang Muo, now both professional basketball players. Smith offered his aunt to feed, clothe and educate Maker in Sydney where Maker played basketball for the St. George Basketball Association during 2011. Just before the team's playoffs, Maker and Smith left to attend a talent camp in Texas.Once in the United States, Maker attended two schools in Louisiana, including Metairie Park Country Day School, before finally settling down at Carlisle School in Martinsville, Virginia.During his freshman and sophomore years playing for Carlisle's varsity team, Maker averaged 22.2 points, 13.1 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.4 steals and 4.5 blocks over a total of 53 games. As a sophomore, he earned 2013–14 Gatorade Virginia Boys Basketball Player of the Year honours after leading Carlisle to a state championship. On 5 September 2014, Maker and his brother enrolled at the Athlete Institute in Mono, Ontario where Edward Smith was already an assistant coach. In conjunction with the Athlete Institute, the brothers enrolled at Orangeville District Secondary School in the nearby town of Orangeville. On 18 February 2015, Maker announced his decision to reclassify into the 2015 class, which would have made 2014–15 his final year of high school. He later participated in the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit in Portland, Oregon. Playing alongside fellow Australian Ben Simmons in the April 11 game, Maker recorded 10 rebounds, two points and one block as the World Team defeated Team USA, 103–101. On 18 June 2015, Maker announced his decision to remain in the Class of 2016, and returned to Orangeville Prep for the 2015–16 season. Maker noted how stressful it was working toward entering the Class of 2015, with the issue centred on his workload and the pressure with ""trying to get it all done at once"". He was being recruited by Arizona State, Florida State, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Notre Dame, St. John's, and UNLV. On 3 April 2016, Maker declared his intentions to enter the 2016 NBA draft, a decision that required a ruling from the NBA to determine his eligibility. To skip a year of college, Maker had to convince the NBA he graduated from Orangeville Prep in 2015. He successfully did so, proving he graduated from high school in June 2015 but stayed another year as a post-graduate student by his own choosing, fulfilling both the minimum age and one year removed requirements to the NBA's satisfaction. With a successful ruling, Maker became just the second player in more than a decade to make the leap from high school in North America straight to the draft and the first to play in the NBA since the league introduced the ""one-and-done"" rule for high school students in 2005. Maker attended the 2016 NBA Draft Combine, where he was measured as the third-tallest player without shoes at 6'11.75"" and recorded the highest no-step vertical jump (32"") of any player over 6'11"" in NBA Draft Combine history. In the days leading up to the draft, a number of teams ruled themselves out of selecting Maker in the first round over concerns that his age had been misrepresented, as some believed Maker to be between 21–23 years of age despite being officially listed as a 19-year-old. Despite those concerns, he was selected with the 10th overall pick in the 2016 draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the first high school player taken in the first round since the 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement went into effect. During the 2016 NBA Summer League, Maker averaged 14.2 points and 9.6 rebounds in five games for the Bucks and subsequently earned All-NBA Summer League Second Team honours. On 30 July 2016, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Bucks. Maker made his NBA debut on 30 October 2016, entering the game with 95 seconds remaining in the final term of the Bucks' 98–83 loss to the Detroit Pistons; he recorded one rebound. On 21 January 2017, he made his first start for the Bucks and subsequently had six points in 18 minutes in a 109–97 loss to the Miami Heat. On 1 February 2017, he scored a season-high 12 points in a 104–88 loss to the Utah Jazz. On 10 February 2017, in the Bucks' first game since Jabari Parker was ruled out for the rest of the season with an ACL injury, Maker started in Parker's place and recorded seven points and six rebounds in 17 minutes in a 122–114 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. The following day, he had a second 12-point effort in a 116–100 win over the Indiana Pacers. On 31 March 2017, he scored a career-high 23 points in a 108–105 overtime win over the Detroit Pistons. On 22 November 2017, Maker scored a season-high 16 points against the Phoenix Suns. On 1 January 2018, he tied his season high with 16 points against the Toronto Raptors. In Game 3 of the Bucks' first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics, Maker scored 14 points and blocked five shots, as the Bucks cut the series deficit to 2–1 with a 116–92 win. He again blocked five shots in Game 4, helping the Bucks even the series at 2–2 with a 104–102 win. The Bucks went on to lose the series in seven games. On 7 January 2019, Maker had a season-high 15 points off the bench in a 114–102 win over the Jazz. By late January, having had a reduced role in 2018–19 under new coach Mike Budenholzer, Maker reportedly requested a trade from the Bucks. On 7 February 2019, Maker was acquired by the Detroit Pistons in a three-team trade involving the Bucks and New Orleans Pelicans. On 22 February, he sank a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 16.7 seconds remaining to lift the Pistons to a 125–122 win over the Atlanta Hawks. In April 2015, Maker declared his intentions to play for the Australian national team despite heavy interest from Basketball Canada—the organization had considered Maker and his younger brother Matur as potential Canadian players. On 29 June 2018, he made his international debut for Australia in a FIBA World Cup qualifier against Japan. Maker was involved in the Philippines–Australia basketball brawl during the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualification. As a result, he was suspended for three games. Maker is an Australian and South Sudanese citizen. Maker's parents, who descend from the Dinka people, still live in South Sudanand are also both extremely tall; his father is 203 cm (6'8"") and his mother is 190 cm (6'3""). His brother, Matur, attempted to enter the 2018 NBA draft in a manner similar to Thon before deciding to play internationally instead. Another brother, Maker Maker, plays soccer for South Melbourne FC's under-20 team. A cousin of Maker's, Makur, attends West Hills Chaminade Prep School in Los Angeles. Another cousin, Aliir Aliir, plays in the Australian Football League for the Sydney Swans.

Cody also appeared on cross-over episodes of other Disney Channel series, such as That's So Raven, Wizards of Waverly Place, Hannah Montana, I'm in the Band, So Random! and the special, Studio DC: Almost Live, as well as being mentioned in an episode of Jessie. Dylan Sprouse stated that the idea of twins living in a hotel was something he and his brother came up with when they were shooting Big Daddy and stayed in a hotel for four months.Sprouse said of Zack and Cody, ""The characters were originally based off our personalities. In fact, they were originally named Dylan and Cole.""Cody was born at St. Joseph's Hospital in Seattle, Washington at 6:40 on a Saturday.The year of his birth is not clear. In The Suite Life on Deck episode, ""Das Boots"", it is said to be 1993.However, in the episode of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody titled ""Poor Little Rich Girl"", a baby video of he and his brother is date-stamped September 23, 1992.The twins attended Buckner Middle School during seasons 1 & 2, Cheevers High School during season 3 of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, and then Seven Seas High on board the SS Tipton in The Suite Life on Deck. Cody is more erudite, mature and intelligent than Zack. Cody tends to be more sensitive, caring and better behaved than his brother, but he is not perfect; he occasionally shows acts of meanness and greed. He generally receives good grades in school, and according to Zack, Cody has a 5.0 grade point average.He is often referred to as a nerd, though he prefers ""educationally gifted"". London Tipton, daughter of the man who owns the Tipton Hotel in which he resides for the duration of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, uses him on various occasions to complete her school work. In one episode of The Suite Life on Deck, Cody and Zack fight over the fact that Zack stole an old term paper from Cody rather than writing his own, and Zack admits that he knows he'll never match Cody academically and feels inferior to his brother; in response, Cody admits that he works hard to get grades because Zack is better at sports, better with girls, and more popular, while the only thing Cody has going for him is his intelligence.He is shown to have a strong, almost obsessive, fear of germs. Despite his exceptional intelligence and relative maturity when compared to Zack, Cody exhibits some comically regressive behaviors, such as calling his mother ""Mommy"", screaming girlishly when frightened, and carrying a ""blankey"" into his teens. This becomes a running joke throughout the series. In ""Big Hair & Baseball"", it is revealed that he has astigmatism. Cody is proven to have a Swedish background in the Suite Life on Deck episode ""The Swede Life"". He originally intended to attend Harvard University; however, he has a bad encounter with a Dean there, as he helped to lie when Zack dated the Dean's daughter.Later on, he decides to attend Yale. Cody says that his biggest dream is to win a Nobel Prize. While he shows the same interest in girls as his brother, he prefers long-term relationships with one girl, rather than dating many girls at once. After traveling around the nation, the twins and their mother Carey arrive in Boston, which becomes their home until The Suite Life on Deck. He and Zack become friends with Maddie Fitzpatrick, and he keeps a picture of her in his room when he moves to the SS Tipton. Cody does well in school and is interested in several intellectual activities. This results in him attending math camp, winning a spelling bee, etc. Like Zack, he inherits musical talents from his parents. He can sing and dance, as seen in Lip-Syncing in the Rain and Sleepover Suite, and can act. In addition to singing, Cody plays the French horn and the violin. Cody is closer than Zack to their mother and heeds her advice. In the first season, Cody is as much of a troublemaker as Zack. As the show progresses, his character develops into a type who generally only gets in trouble by mistake or (more often) due to Zack's influence. Cody is often the victim of various sight gags (which range from humorous to traumatic). Examples include being pushed in horse feces, getting trampled, and being frozen in ice (which he does not remember). During the third season, Cody works part-time as a bag boy at the Paul Revere minimart over the summer holidays. It becomes a setting and theme for some episodes, most notably Summer of Our Discontent, Who's the Boss? and Baggage. Cody acted as producer of London Tipton's ""Yay Me! Starring London Tipton"" webcast, although he quits or rejoins the show based on his relationship with London. Cody shares a room with Woody Fink, a messy, overweight student. While at school on board the SS Tipton, Cody becomes the ship's towel boy to earn money after Zack maxes out both of their student cash cards on non-essential items, particularly food and gifts for girls Zack is interested in. He develops a competitor in school, Bailey Pickett. He develops a crush on Bailey after finding out that she, who initially masqueraded as a boy, is a girl. Cody pursues Bailey several times throughout the first season, most notably in the episode ""International Dateline"" when he plans on telling her how he feels at a school dance but is thwarted by Zack, London, Woody, Mrs. Pepperman (a woman looking for the senior citizens' karate class), and, repeatedly, by a supernatural event upon the ship's crossing the International Dateline which causes Cody to relive the previous several hours a la Groundhog Day; and, as revealed in the episode ""It's All Greek to Me"", devising a six-month plan to win her heart. She is oblivious. In the season one finale ""Double Crossed"" (part of the ""Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana"" crossover special), after Hannah Montana gives Cody tickets to the concert in Hawaii, Bailey kisses him, starting their relationship. In ""Lost at Sea"", in the second season, Cody goes behind Bailey's back while the group is sailing in a lifeboat. Bailey gets angry with him and treats him badly. After advice from Zack, they reconcile and becomes the hero by figuring out a way off the island. Cody becomes friends with Zack's roommate Marcus Little, a former singing sensation. In the second season finale ""Breakup in Paris"", Cody and Bailey have a major argument that concludes a breakup. However, Cody still has feelings for Bailey. In ""A London Carol"", an alternate future shows that Cody and Bailey are married, although the present Cody and Bailey are still separated. In the third season, Zack begins a romantic relationship with Maya Bennett, and Cody has a friendly relationship with her. In the episode ""Computer Date"", Arwin builds a supercomputer that displays affectionate feelings for Cody, who feels the same way. However, when Callie starts endangering Cody's friends, he shuts her down. In the episode ""The Play's The Thing"", Cody writes a play that covers the breakup, which causes Bailey to quit the play. Haley is killed at the end of the play, and Bailey runs off crying. Cody admits that the play is based on their breakup, and Zack convinces his brother to try to reconcile with Bailey. When he attempts to do so, she slams the door in his face. In the ""Twister"" three-part special, Bailey decides that she still loves Cody, and they resume their relationship. In ""Graduation on Deck"", the series finale, Cody is rejected by Yale University. He is so sad that he refuses to speak as the valedictorian with Bailey, although he finally relents. Near the end of the episode, Cody promises to visit her at Yale. Cody and Bailey originally plan to spend spring break together, but Cody decides instead to intern for Dr. Spaulding for the opportunity to earn a Yale scholarship. He writes a long letter to Bailey explaining his decision, but he starts to quarrel with Zack and loses the letter. She becomes upset with him. Cody goes to the marine biology lab where he will intern, but Zack gets him into a quarrel and they damage the lab's property, costing Cody his spot. Cody becomes more furious with Zack. Zack attempts to make it up to him, and helps Cody to get an internship with Dr. Olsen in the Gemini Project. There they eat a fruit that connects them telepathically: first through tactile sensation, then through empathy or emotions, and finally through a process called ""the merge"". The first stages bring the brothers closer, but after discovering that the merge will combine them into a single personality, they try to escape.",26436,2694,2019-20,38.0,1.0,616.0,3.7,8.5,0.434,0.8,3.3,0.25,2.9,5.2,0.551,1.8,2.6,0.667,1.7,4.7,6.4,3.0,1.6,0.4,1.6,3.4,9.9,4.0,Charlotte Hornets

He played and started in 31 contests and shot 39.9 percent from the field. His shooting percentages dipped to 39.9 percent from the field, as did Lehigh's record, and McCollum was edged out for conference Player of the Year honors by Mike Muscala of the Bucknell Bisons. CJ was named First Team All-Conference.As a junior in the 2011-12 campaign, CJ again earned Patriot League Player of the Year, as well as his third straight First Team All-Conference designation.In 2012, the Mountain Hawks beat the Duke Blue Devils, 75-70, in the school’s first ever victory at the NCAA Division I Tournament, during which McCollum posted a game-high 30 points; this marked only the sixth time in the history of the tournament that a team seeded 15th defeated a team seeded 2nd.Over his four collegiate years, McCollum grew into his body by degrees and weight-trained with the same regularity, having the result that he added 30 pounds of muscle.Even though he was already considered virtually destined to be a top NBA draft pick by his third year, he decided to finish his final year of college instead of leaving sooner for the NBA; a consummate student of journalism, McCollum penned an article for Sporting News explaining why he opted to continue on with his education.On November 25, 2012, McCollum scored 26 points in a 91-77 win over Sacred Heart, to pass Rob Feaster as the Patriot League's all-time leading scorer.On January 5, 2013, McCollum broke his left foot in a game against Virginia Commonwealth University, ending his season early. He was a 2012–13 Senior CLASS Award finalist.McCollum went on to graduate from Lehigh University with a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism received May 20, 2013. The first player to ever enter the league out of the private school, Lehigh, McCollum was picked tenth overall in the 2013 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. He signed his rookie scale contract with the franchise on July 11, and he proceeded to play for them in the NBA Summer League, averaging 21 points and 4 rebounds per game. Having convened for an annual photoshoot, the rookie class of 2013 took an NBA.com survey, according to which McCollum was voted the 2013–14 Rookie of the Year (together with Victor Oladipo). CJ sat out the first six weeks of the regular season with a foot injury. On January 1, 2014, he was assigned to the Idaho Stampede of the development league. He was recalled by the Blazers on January 5 and made his NBA debut three days later, during which he notched 4 points as Portland beat the Orlando Magic, 110-94. On February 8, CJ posted a season-high 19 points in a 117-110 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. On October 27, 2014, Portland exercised their third-year team option to extended McCollum's rookie scale contract through 2015–16. For his sophomore season, he played 15.7 minutes per outing while averaging 6.8 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 1 assist across 62 games. During a first-round playoff loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, Game 5, McCollum scored a then career-high of 33 points. Exercising their fourth-year team option on September 30, 2015, the Trail Blazers extended McCollum's rookie scale-contract through the 2016–17 season. With Portland's previous starters—Aldridge, Matthews, and Lopez—having departed, only star point guard Damian Lillard remained; thus CJ was elevated to starting shooting guard to join Lillard in the backcourt for the 2015–16 campaign. As such, he saw his minutes increase to 34.8 per contest, and he started in all 80 games that he played. For the season, he would average 20.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 4.3 assists a night across 80 games. In the season-opener on October 28, McCollum posted a career-high 37 points, scoring 22 of which in the first quarter alone, helping the Blazers defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 112-94. After injury decommissioned Lillard in late December, McCollum filled in as the primary point guard. On December 27, McColllum put up 35 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 9 assists during a 98-94 win over the Sacramento Kings. No Blazer had recorded numbers on par with McCollum's near triple-double in the last 29 years (Clyde Drexler posted 34 points, 11 rebounds, and 9 assists or more on five occasions.) McCollum was able to resume his starting shooting guard role on January 4 as Lillard was back on his feet, returned from injury. On February 12, he was named among the invites to All-Star Weekend's Three-Point Contest. On April 5, he posted his eighth 30-point game of the season, during a 115-107 win over Sacramento. By the end of the regular season, he averaged 20.8 points per game, while Lillard did 25.1 points, making the first backcourt to average 20 or more points apiece in Blazers' history. McCollum would subsequently earn NBA Most Improved Player honors for his breakout 2015–16 season. McCollum helped the Blazers claim victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, 4-2, in the first round of the playoffs. However, Portland was then ousted in the second round matchup by the Golden State Warriors, going down 4-1; though it would come in the 125-121 loss that ended the Blazers' postseason run, McCollum recorded his third 27-point game of the playoffs during Game 5. On July 27, 2016, McCollum signed a four-year contract extension with Portland. McCollum would start in all 80 games that he played and would average 23 points as well as 3.6 rebounds and as many assists. In the season-opener on October 25, he put up 25 points to help defeat the Utah Jazz, 113-104. Only four days later, he posted 23 points, 10 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals, and a career-high 3 blocks as Portland beat the Denver Nuggets, 115-113, in an overtime contest. During a 100-94 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on November 6, he matched his earlier career-high by racking up 37 points. On November 20, CJ scored 33 points and hit a career-high 6 three-pointers, to defeat the Brooklyn Nets 129-109. On December 10, he set a new career-high of 7 three-pointers made and finished with 34 points scored in a 118-111 loss to the Indiana Pacers. He set another career-high for points scored with 43 on January 1 during a 95-89 win over the Timberwolves. In a game on January 13, a 115-109 loss to the Orlando Magic, he posted 26 points to extended his streak of games with 25-plus points to eight in a row, the third-longest in Blazers' history (only Geoff Petrie with 11 and Clyde Drexler with 9 games have had longer among Blazers players.) On February 7, McCollum scored 32 points; the last two of which, on a runner from the top of the lane, clinched the 114-113 win over the Dallas Mavericks with 0.9 seconds left. In a 122-113 victory over Denver on March 28, McCollum finished with a 39-point tally. The Blazers finished the regular season with a 41-41 record and entered the playoffs as the eighth seed. On April 16, 2017, Portland lost 121-109 to the Warriors in Game 1 of the first-round series; yet McCollum's 41 points during the game was his postseason career-best and made him only the eighth Blazer with a 40-point playoff performance. McCollum missed the opener of the 2017–18 season due to a single-game suspension incurred when he left the bench area once during a preseason game. CJ would play in 80 games and start in all of them while averaging 21.4 points, 4 rebounds, and 3.4 assists a night. In his season debut on October 20, he put up 28 points on 12-of-18 shooting to lead his team past the Indiana Pacers, 114-96. He recorded as many as 36 points during a 98-97 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on November 7. On the 25th of that month, McCollum had 26 points and scored 7 straight in the final quarter, as he helped Portland stage a 10-0 scoring run to overcome a 17-point deficit and defeat the Washington Wizards, 108-105. On January 1, to defeat the Chicago Bulls, 124-120, he scored 25 of 32 points after halftime, including the game-clinching basket with 56.5 seconds left in overtime. During a game on January 31, as Portland defeated the Bulls, 124-108, McCollum scored a franchise-record 28 points in the first quarter alone, and he finished with a career-high 50 points in only three periods before heading to the bench for the fourth. He joined Damian Lillard, Damon Stoudamire, Brandon Roy, Andre Miller, Clyde Drexler and Geoff Petrie as Trail Blazers to score 50 points or more. On March 28, McCollum had a 42-point effort, which came in a 108-103 loss to the Grizzlies. In Game 4 of the Trail Blazers' first-round playoff series against the New Orleans Pelicans, McCollum scored 38 points in a 131-123 loss. The loss eliminated Portland from the playoffs, the last in a four-game sweep. Across 70 games, starting in all of them, McCollum would average 21 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists for the season. On November 6, 2018, McCollum scored 40 points during a 118-103 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 12, he matched his season high with 40 points during a 92-83 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.

On December 30, he broke out of a six-game funk by hitting 13 of 18 shots in a 35-point performance as the Trail Blazers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 129-95. On January 22, he scored 31 points and made seven 3-pointers in a 123-114 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, thus passing Nicolas Batum (751) for fourth on the franchise's all-time 3-pointers list. On January 26, he recorded his first career triple-double with 28 points, 10 assists, and 10 rebounds in a 120-111 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On March 1, he scored 35 points and matched a career best by making seven 3-pointers in a 119-117 loss to the Toronto Raptors. McCollum missed 10 games over late March and early April with a left knee injury. In Game 3 of the Trail Blazers' second-round playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, McCollum matched his career playoff high with 41 points during a 140-137 win in quadruple-overtime. In Game 6, he scored 30 points in a 119-108 win, helping the Blazers tie the series against the Nuggets at 3-3. In the deciding Game 7, he scored a game-high 37 points in a 100-96 win, advancing the Blazers to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2000. Portland went on to lose the conference finals in a four-game sweep to the Warriors. McCollum's older brother, Errick, is also a professional basketball player. Off the court, CJ has long taken a keen interest in journalism. As such, he has written articles concerning the NBA for various media outlets; in one of his pieces, he interviewed the Commissioner of the league Adam Silver. McCollum is involved in his community as a radio personality and philanthropist. In 2016, he opened up the CJ McCollum Dream Center, which is an innovative learning room at the Blazers Boys & Girls Club outfitted with new computers, books, art, and learning tools. The Center aims to provide a safe and inspiring space for underserved youth to learn, explore, create, and grow. CJ also helps foster local youths' interest in journalists through an initiative called CJ's Press Pass; it grants aspiring journalists access to postgame news conferences and provides them the opportunity to attend events with McCollum, to receive personalized mentorship from members of the media, and to have their work published.",26443,2766,2019-20,52.0,52.0,1856.0,8.5,19.1,0.446,2.7,7.1,0.383,5.8,12.0,0.484,1.7,2.3,0.75,0.6,3.3,3.9,3.8,0.7,0.6,1.8,2.6,21.5,25.0,Portland Trail Blazers

While playing college basketball for Creighton University, he led the nation in scoring in 2013–14 and was a three-time consensus first-team All-American. He was the consensus national player of the year as a senior in 2014, and finished his college career with the fifth-most points in NCAA Division I men's basketball history. After graduating from Creighton, McDermott became automatically eligible for the 2014 NBA draft, where he was drafted 11th overall by the Denver Nuggets.

He was selected 18th overall by the Washington Wizards in the 2008 NBA draft. He is a two-time NBA champion, having won consecutive titles with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018 before signing with the Lakers. McGee was born in Flint, Michigan, and attended two high schools in Michigan, Detroit Country Day School and Providence Christian, before transferring to Hales Franciscan High School in Chicago.According to Hales Franciscan coach Gary London, McGee's natural position in college was ideally small forward, and he could play both forward spots.McGee was the starting center for the University of Nevada. After his sophomore campaign, in which he averaged 14.3 points and 7.3 rebounds, shooting 53% from the field and 33% from three-point range, McGee decided to hire an agent and declare for the 2008 NBA draft.McGee was selected 18th overall by the Wizards in the 2008 NBA draft.

His teammates were photographed smiling and laughing with him.On January 6, 2011, McGee was chosen to participate in the 2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.McGee was the first Wizard to ever participate in the contest. He finished in second place, losing to Blake Griffin.

On March 15, 2011, in a 98–79 loss against the Chicago Bulls, McGee notched his first career triple-double, recording 11 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 blocks. His career high 12 blocks was the most since Keon Clark had 12 on March 23, 2001.However, he received some criticism for taking ill-advised shots in the fourth quarter to ensure he reached 10 points while his team was being blown out, and even received a technical foul for excessive celebration by pulling himself on the rim after a dunk for his final points. Television commentator Kevin McHale called it a ""bad triple-double"".In response to the criticism, McGee said, ""I got a triple-double. Who can say they got a triple-double? I'm not really worried about it.""During the 2011 NBA lockout, NBPA leaders met with around 30 players on October 14 and stressed unity. McGee left the meeting early and told reporters there were some players ""saying that they're ready to fold"", but the majority was united. McGee later denied mentioning that players were ready to fold, but his comment was recorded by reporters. Derek Fisher said McGee had ""no ability to make that statement"" based on the limited time he spent at the meeting. McGee averaged over 10 points and eight rebounds in 2010–11 and 2011–12 with the Wizards. On March 15, 2012, McGee was traded to the Nuggets along with Ronny Turiaf in a deal that sent Nenê to the Wizards.

McGee visited the Philippines twice during the 2011 NBA lockout, first in exhibition games with NBA stars against players from the Philippine Basketball Association and the Smart Gilas national team, and then in a basketball clinic. Later that year, he expressed his interest in playing for the Philippine national team, and in 2012, a bill was filed for his Filipino citizenship to make him eligible to play for Smart Gilas. In 2014, McGee was asked again by the Gilas Pilipinas to take part as a naturalized player for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. However, national teams were limited to one naturalized player apiece, and former Wizards teammate Andray Blatche made the World Cup team after he was granted citizenship. In 2013, McGee started Juglife Foundation, an organization that brings awareness of drinking water and hydration. He has hosted celebrity softball games involving his NBA colleagues. Juglife has partnered with Hope 4 Kids International in building wells in Uganda.

McGee is also cousins with former NFL defensive end Jarron Gilbert. In 2013, it was announced that McGee would be starring in his own reality television show, Mom's Got Game, with his mother. McGee had the largest documented armspan of any current NBA player at 7 ft 6.5 in (2.30 m) until the Nuggets drafted Rudy Gobert, with an armspan at 7 ft 8.5 in (2.35 m) in the 2013 NBA draft. McGee has been featured regularly on Inside the NBA's basketball blooper feature ""Shaqtin' a Fool"", earning the nickname ""Tragic Bronson"", a play on Magic Johnson, from Shaquille O'Neal.

He played college basketball for the Kansas Jayhawks and was known for his athletic ability complemented by his outstanding jump shot. His size, style of play and unique set of abilities had garnered comparisons to former NBA All-Star Ray Allen.He was the seventh pick in the 2013 NBA draft.McLemore played high school basketball at Wellston High School in St. Louis, Missouri for three years, before his school was shut down in 2010. He then attended both Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia and Christian Life Center in Humble, Texas during his senior year of high school. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, McLemore was listed as the No. 9 shooting guard and the No. 34 player in the nation in 2011.After committing to Kansas, McLemore was deemed ineligible to play by the NCAA because he attended multiple high schools, resulting in his transcripts being ""a little fuzzy"". He was allowed to practice with the team and take part in team activities starting in the second semester of the school year. At the beginning of his college career, McLemore was considered to be either a late first-round or early second-round prospect.

Wooden Award.

Lending credence to Cobb's allegations, McLemore had Blackstock on his guest pass list for at least three Kansas home games that season, and subsequently signed Blackstock as his NBA agent.

He also represents the senior Italian national team. He mainly plays at the power forward position, but he has also played at center. Melli earned an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection in 2017. The Reggio Emilia native started his career with home town side Pallacanestro Reggiana. After an accumulation of injuries Melli was called up to train with the senior team in October 2004, at only 13. He sat on the bench during a 24 October league game (an age record) though he did not play and returned to the youth teams afterwards.In October 2006 he participated in the Italian leg of the Jordan Classic Camp international tour, regrouping a selection of the thirty most promising under-16 players, with the MVP earning a trip to the American edition of the camp.Melli was selected as co-MVP, meeting Michael Jordan and going to the U.S. in April 2007.He talked of recruiting interest from American college UCLA during the same period.In August 2007, he signed a five-year professional contract with Pallacanestro Reggiana and started training with the first team.The same year, in October, the 16-year-old debuted in the Italian national second division LegaDue. In May 2008, during the promotion semifinals against Aurora Basket Jesi, he replaced injured starter Benjamin Ortner and contributed 16 points and 15 rebounds in a losing effort. He finished the season playing an average of 10.6 minutes with 3.4 points and 2.9 rebounds. During the off-season, the 17-year-old participated in the Reebok Eurocamp in Treviso but did not make an impression on observers (albeit playing against older players, sometimes by five years). He also returned to the U.S., attending the Adidas Nations that pitted international teams of promising youngsters. Though he was praised by an observer for his work ethic, it was also noted that his game (and lack of athleticism) was unsuited to the American game. Melli started the next season in great form, with 12 points and 18 rebounds followed by 24 points in two games, however, on 21 December 2008, Melli suffered a serious knee injury. Scans revealed an anterior cruciate ligament injury on his left knee, requiring surgery and at least five months of rehabilitation though he would be able to continue his career. He returned to action in 2009–10 as a starter; he averaged 10.7 points and 7.1 rebounds in 28 minutes, though he missed the promotion playoffs because of a shoulder injury. On the radar of strong sides for some time, Melli joined Armani Jeans Milano, of the elite domestic Serie A and European EuroLeague in July 2010, signing a four-year deal. After struggling to earn minutes, Melli was loaned to fellow Serie A side Scavolini-Siviglia Pesaro in February 2011. A month later he returned to Milan, to take part in the Italian All Star Game where he contributed 12 points for Italy. Melli finished the 2010–11 season with 3.8 points, 3.3 rebounds and 1.1 steals in 16 minutes per game for Pesaro (compared with 9 minutes for Milan previously). The next season saw Melli accrue slightly more playing time but despite some highlights, such as a team-high 17 points in a EuroLeague Group G defeat against UNICS Kazan, he finished the regular season with 3.4 points and 2.7 rebounds in 11 minutes per game (Serie A) and 3.8 points and 1.9 rebounds in 9 minutes per game (EuroLeague). He had more impact in the Serie A playoffs, including decisive performances in the semifinal game 3 against former side Pesaro (5 points in 19 minutes and a good defensive performance, with 7 rebounds, 2 steals and 1 block) and then in game 4 of the finals against future champions Montepaschi Siena where he was part of a second-half fightback to win the game, finishing with 11 points and 4 rebounds in 13 minutes. In 2012–13, Melli increased his averages to 5.8 points and 4.1 rebounds (Serie A), 4.6 points and 3 rebounds (EuroLeague), and his minutes to respectively 17 and 15 in a season nearly devoid of highlights both personally and for Milan (eliminated in the domestic quarterfinals and the EuroLeague regular season). An exception was his third successive participation in the December Italian league All-Star Game, in which he top-scored along with Milan teammate Alessandro Gentile (18 points), adding a game-best 10 rebounds. During the summer, he worked out with a number of NBA sides, with an observer commenting that he seemed too light physically for the league, he would go undrafted in the 2013 NBA draft. 2013–14 proved to be Melli's breakthrough season, with his good performances becoming more regular as he cemented his place in Milan's starting five. The first of those decisive contributions came in Milan's second EuroLeague game of the season against Žalgiris, where Melli scored a career-high 20 points, adding 9 rebounds and 2 steals in 25 minutes to earn a PIR of 28. During the decisive 74-73 victory against Brose Bamberg in the penultimate group stage game, he defended Wright as he missed the Brose's last shot which allowed Milan to progress to the Top 16. Though he lad less impact further on as Milan reached the EuroLeague quarterfinals, Melli finished with respectable averages of 5.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, 0.8 assists and 0.9 steals in around 21 minutes in the competition. Domestically, he regularly posted scored in double figures, including a career-high 24 points against Roma, put against more average games he finished with 6.9 points and 4.9 rebounds in a career-high 21 minutes. Discarding the statistics, Melli had crucial contributions during the Serie A playoffs, starting with 18 points in 22 minutes in the first game against Pistoia. After starting the finals series against defending champions Montepaschi Siena with some off-games Melli exploded in the final two games. In the do-or-die game 6, with Milan trailing, he scored two successive three-pointers to regain the lead before adding a steal and a number of decisive rebounds as Milan won the game to earn a game 7 decider. In that game, he contributed 11 points and a career-high 13 rebounds as Milan won to become Italian champions for the first time in 18 years. In July 2014, his contract with Milan was extended for another year. The season proved more difficult for both parties, Melli had an unremarkable season (5.3 points and 3.5 rebounds in the EuroLeague, 5.6 and 4.3 in Serie A) as Milan were stopped in the Italian playoff semifinals in their title defense and stalled in the EuroLeague Top 16. Melli moved abroad in July 2015, signing with German side Brose Bamberg for two years. He cited Brose's strong pursuit of his services and their offering him a more important role in the side as motivation for the move abroad, adding that the presence of compatriots Andrea Trinchieri and Daniele Baiesi as head coach and GM respectively would facilitate his adaptation. Melli was named the MVP of the Month of November of the 2015–16 EuroLeague. Melli was named the EuroLeague Round 11 MVP, after scoring 27 points and grabbing 14 rebounds, in a 70–85 away victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv, on 8 December 2016. He was named to the season's All-EuroLeague Second Team. On July 8, 2017, Melli signed a three-year contract with Turkish club Fenerbahçe. In the 2017–18 EuroLeague season, Fenerbahçe made it to the 2018 EuroLeague Final Four, its fourth consecutive Final Four appearance. Eventually, they lost to Real Madrid, by a score of 80–85 in the finals game. In the finals game, Melli was the finals top scorer, as he scored 28 points, which was the most points scored in a EuroLeague Finals game by a player since 1985. He had a season-best performance in the EuroLeague Finals, scoring 28 points and grabbing 6 rebounds. Over 36 EuroLeague games played in total, he averaged 8.9 points, 5 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game. On July 25, 2019, Melli signed with the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA). On October 22, 2019, Melli made his debut in NBA, coming off the bench in a 122–130 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors with fourteen points, five rebounds and two assists. Melli played with the Italian Under-16 side at the 2007 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship, averaging 13.1 points, 9.8 rebounds and 2 blocks per game (all three team bests), as he was selected to the tournament's best five. With the U-18's at the 2008 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, he averaged 9.5 points and 6.4 rebounds per game (the latter a team best). In the 2011 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship, Melli contributed 10.1 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1 block per game, in nearly 25 minutes played per game, including 23 points and 11 rebounds in the quarterfinal against Montenegro, to help Italy reach the final. He had an off-game against Spain in the semifinal, grabbing 7 rebounds and scoring 9 points, but shooting 2 for 8 from the floor, and committing four fouls, as Italy had to make do with a silver medal. Melli made his full debut (discounting the All-Star Game) for the senior Italian team in August 2011, though he was rarely called up until 2013. After being called up to the Italy squad for EuroBasket 2013, the power forward had to play in an unfamiliar center position, due to the lack of big men in Italy's squad. Alternating at the position with Marco Cusin, he was pitted against bigger and stronger opponents, finishing the tournament with a respectable 4.4 points and 4.3 rebounds per game, in around 16 minutes played per game – with highs of 14 points and 10 rebounds against Turkey - as Italy reached the tournament's quarterfinals. Melli also played at the EuroBasket 2015. Note: The EuroLeague is not the only competition in which the player participated for the team during the season. He also played in domestic competition, and regional competition if applicable. Melli is the son of the former volleyball player Julie Vollertsen—a silver medalist with the United States at the 1984 Olympic Games—and corporate lawyer (formerly amateur basketball player for Pallacanestro Reggiana and television journalist) Leopoldo Melli. They met when Vollertsen moved from the U.S. to Reggio Emilia to play professionally. Enrico, Melli's younger brother who was born in 1995, has also played basketball for Reggiana. Melli is a dual citizen of Italy and the United States.However, the first time he visited the latter was at 16 and he doesn't feel very American.

He liked the college town atmosphere, and got along well with the coaching staff.Middleton was recruited by then Texas A&M assistant coach Scott Spinelli. Coming into his freshman year, Middleton expected to fill the three point shooting void of departed senior Josh Carter. Middleton's college career started slowly, connecting on 1-of-12 field goals in limited action of his first three games.After a season-ending leg injury to Derrick Roland on December 11, 2009, Middleton was forced to take a larger role in the offense and started 18 of the last 20 games.

He was recognized as an All-Eighth District second-team selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All‐America teams. Since the Big 12 Conference was its own district, this is equivalent to being named second team All-Big 12 by the NABC.

He played college basketball for the Murray State Racers, where he was a consensus first-team All-American as a sophomore in 2019. He was selected by the Grizzlies with the second overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft. The Dalzell, South Carolina native and son of former basketball player Tee Morant was only lightly recruited by NCAA Division I programs and unranked by recruiting services; this was despite having been named All-Region Most Valuable Player three times and earning All-State honors at Crestwood High School in Sumter, South Carolina. However, he made an immediate impact at Murray State, earning first-team all-conference honors in the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) as a freshman. Morant had a breakout sophomore season, which saw him win OVC Player of the Year and lead the NCAA in assists. As a sophomore, he also became the first player in NCAA history to average at least 20 points and 10 assists per game in a single season. Morant was born in Augusta, Georgia, to Tee and Jamie Morant.His father was a high school teammate of Ray Allen and played basketball for Claflin University before starting a professional career abroad. However, he ended his basketball career when Ja was born and became a barber instead.Morant trained in his backyard with his father, who taught him step-back jump shots and bought tractor tires for him to practice jumping with a soft landing.In his childhood, he often faced older opponents, telling his mother, ""I'm not worried about the big kids.""Morant played in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) circuit with the South Carolina Hornets, a small grassroots team based in Columbia, South Carolina. For a single season, he was teammates with Zion Williamson, who would become one of the top players in his class.Morant attended Crestwood High School in Sumter, South Carolina.He grew from 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) to 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) in his first three years with the basketball team.Morant left as its all-time leading scorer, with 1,679 points and set a career-high with 47 points against Sumter High School.In his final two seasons for Crestwood, he averaged 27 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists per game, earning South Carolina Class 3A All-State honors in both years.

His only high major NCAA Division I offer came from South Carolina. He was accidentally discovered by mid-major program Murray State of the OVC in July 2016, when assistant coach James Kane attended a camp hoping to see a player who was joining his team. While looking for a snack, Kane noticed Morant playing a three-on-three game in an auxiliary gym; impressed, he contacted head coach Matt McMahon, who soon offered Morant a scholarship. On September 3, 2016, Morant committed to playing for Murray State during dinner at McMahon's house. His father said, ""Every parent wants their child to play at a big-time program, but what I realized is, don't go where you want to be, go to where they want you.""His other Division I offers included Duquesne, Maryland Eastern Shore, South Carolina State, and Wofford.

Morant had 15 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds in that game. Murray State would lose in its opening round game to West Virginia, however, falling 85-68 despite Morant's 14 points. Morant began to register on the radar of some scouts the summer of his sophomore season in 2018. He was one of 20 players invited to Chris Paul's Elite Guard Camp, which Morant called, ""an honor.""

By around December 2018, Morant was almost unanimously projected as a top-five selection in the 2019 NBA draft, and in late January 2019, at least one outlet forecasted him as the first overall selection. At that time, then-Yahoo Sports journalist Pat Forde wrote, ""He seems almost certain to be the first top-ten pick from a mid-major school in five years (Elfrid Payton, Louisiana-Lafayette), and could be the first true mid-major pick in the top five since Michael Olowokandi of Pacific went No. 1 in 1998.""

After posting 25 points, 8 rebounds, and 14 assists in a 102–70 victory over Eastern Kentucky, Morant became the 46th Murray State player with 1,000 career points and eclipsed the OVC record for single-season assists previously held for 32 years by Duane Washington of Middle Tennessee. At the end of the regular season, he was named OVC Player of the Year and first-team All-OVC, while leading the NCAA Division I in assists. He later earned first-team All-American honors from the United States Basketball Writers Association and second-team All-American honors from Sporting News. On March 8, in the semifinals of the OVC Tournament versus Jacksonville State, Morant scored 29 points, including a game-winning three-point play. One day later, he recorded 36 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists in a 77–65 upset victory over the Belmont Bruins, who were playing without injured first team All-OVC center Nick Muszynski, for the OVC Tournament title.

Morris started in 16 games to start the season before being benched by coach Jeff Hornacek from December 4 onwards. During the fourth quarter of the Suns' December 23 game against the Denver Nuggets, Morris threw a towel in the direction of Hornacek as he was heading to the bench. The following day, Morris was suspended for two games for conduct detrimental to the team, and was later labelled one of Arizona's biggest sports villains by AZCentral.com. Following an injury to teammate Alex Len in early January, Morris was reinserted back in the rotation to help fortify the frontcourt. On February 2, 2016, during Earl Watson's first game as head coach for the Suns, he had a season-best game with 30 points, 11 rebounds, 6 assists, 2 blocks and 1 steal in a 104–97 loss to the Toronto Raptors. Four days later, he recorded 17 points and a career-high eight assists in a loss to the Utah Jazz. During his last game with the Suns on February 10 against the Golden State Warriors, Morris and teammate Archie Goodwin got into a physical altercation on the bench and were seen arguing during a timeout. The argument escalated into a shoving match between the pair, as teammates quickly stepped in and separated the two. On February 18, 2016, Morris was traded to the Washington Wizards in exchange for DeJuan Blair, Kris Humphries and a 2016 Top–9 protected first round draft pick.

On April 16, 2017, Morris scored 21 points in his NBA playoff debut as the Wizards defeated the Atlanta Hawks 114–107 in Game 1 of their first-round series. On September 22, 2017, Morris was ruled out for six to eight weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a sports hernia. On March 13, 2018, he scored a season-high 27 points in a 116–111 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. On January 3, 2019, Morris was ruled out for six weeks following a bout of neck and upper back stiffness that led to him being diagnosed with transient cervical neurapraxia. On February 7, 2019, Morris was traded, along with a 2023 second-round pick, to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Wesley Johnson. He was waived by the Pelicans the following day. On February 20, 2019, Morris signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder. On July 6, 2019, Morris signed with the Detroit Pistons. Morris' identical twin brother Marcus was selected 14th overall by the Houston Rockets in the 2011 NBA draft. Markieff is seven minutes older than Marcus. His nickname is ""Keef"". He is a fan of the Dallas Cowboys, while Marcus is a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles. On January 24, 2015, both Markieff and Marcus Morris found themselves involved with two aggravated assault cases as five different men (including the twins and former Baltimore Ravens safety Gerald Bowman) allegedly assaulted a 36-year-old man named Eric Hood outside of the Nina Mason Pulliam Recreation Center in Phoenix, Arizona. Hood had previously mentored the Morris twins from high school until the end of their college careers, while the brothers would beat Hood up for ""sending an inappropriate text message"" to their mother. While the case against the Morris brothers was first set up during the summer of 2015, the trial for the twins concluded on October 2, 2017, with both the twins and Gerald Bowman declared as not guilty, while the other people involved (Julius Kane and Christopher Melendez Jr.) confessed their guilt in September 2017. Even with their apparent innocence, the incident was not only considered a catalyst for the Suns to trade Marcus to the Detroit Pistons on July 9, 2015; but it was also one of the biggest reasons why the Suns traded Markieff to the Wizards over eight months later on February 18, 2016.

His collegiate basketball career ended in his first season with a tear of his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) at the University of Kentucky. Noel was drafted with the sixth overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the New Orleans Pelicans. His rights were later traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. He plays center and power forward, and was one of the top high school basketball players in the class of 2012. Born in Malden, Massachusetts to Haitian immigrant parents, Noel spent his first two years of high school at Everett High School.After his sophomore year, he transferred to Tilton School in Tilton, New Hampshire.Noel was originally a part of the class of 2013, but reclassified to the 2012 college recruiting class.Noel averaged 12.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.9 blocks per game as a senior.He was rated as the #1 player in the class of 2012 by ESPNand Scout.com,and the #2 player by SLAM.Noel was selected to play in the 2012 Nike Hoop Summit and the 2012 Jordan Brand Classic. In addition to his high school career, Noel also played AAU basketball on the same team as future Sixers teammate Michael Carter-Williams. Shortly before his high school graduation, an article in the New York Times described Noel as being hailed as one of the best shot blockers of his generation, although he was also described as having unrefined offensive skills.After deliberating among several elite college basketball programs,Noel decided in April 2012 that he would be going to the University of Kentucky to play NCAA Division I basketball. He made his verbal commitment by revealing the UK logo shaved in the back of his head on national television. Since Noel was well known for his elite shot blocking abilities, fans and the media had high expectations for him to fill the shoes of Anthony Davis, who had just led the Kentucky Wildcats to a national championship in the previous season, was the 2011–2012 National Player of the Year in the NCAA, and set a Kentucky and NCAA freshman single-season block record with 186. In his third game on November 16, 2012, he accumulated 15 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 block, and 4 steals against Lafayette. On January 12, 2013, although Kentucky lost the game against Texas A&M, Noel recorded 15 points, 11 rebounds, 7 blocks, 6 assists, and 4 steals. On January 29, 2013, Noel set the UK single-game record with 12 blocks in an 87–74 team victory over #16 Ole Miss. Five of the blocks happened while Noel had four personal fouls, and two of them were denials on slam dunk attempts. The UK school record was previously nine blocks, set by Sam Bowie in 1981 and was then tied by Andre Riddick in 1993. Although he recorded only two points, Ole Miss coach Andy Kennedy said in the post-game press conference that ""[Noel] was the difference in the game"" and that he is ""an incredible defensive presence."" Ole Miss senior forward Murphy Holloway added that he believes Nerlens Noel is the ""best shot blocker [he has] played against"", including Anthony Davis. On February 12, 2013, in a game against the Florida Gators, Noel tore the ACL in his left knee after blocking a Florida lay-up, forcing him to sit out the remainder of the season. Before his injury, it was projected that he would be the 1st overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft. Despite his injury, Noel decided to declare for the 2013 draft on April 15, 2013. Noel was honored with many awards, including SEC Freshman of the Year, SEC Defensive Player of the Year, SEC First Team, SEC All Freshman Team, and SEC Community Service Team. In addition to earning All-SEC first team honors by the league's coaches, Noel earned first-team honors from the Associated Press, continuing a four-year streak of UK players earning first-team AP honors. The Wildcats' 6-foot-11 center was joined by UNLV Runnin' Rebels's Anthony Bennett, UCLA Bruins's Shabazz Muhammad, Oklahoma State Cowboys's Marcus Smart and Kansas Jayhawks's Ben McLemore on the Freshman All-America team. He was the fifth UK player under coach John Calipari to earn the honor from the USBWA, joining John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Anthony Davis, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Noel entered the 2013 NBA draft after playing one season at the University of Kentucky and was projected to be one of the top picks, with many considering Noel the favorite to be picked first in the draft. He was invited to sit in the ""green room"", a room of the projected top 10–15 collegiate basketball players during the draft and ended up being selected with the sixth overall pick by the New Orleans Pelicans. There were concerns around the league about his torn left ACL, which may have caused him to slide down the draft. Later that night, Noel's draft rights were traded along with a 2014 first round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for guard Jrue Holiday and the draft rights to Pierre Jackson. On July 12, 2013, the trade sending Noel to the 76ers was finalized. On September 24, 2013, he signed with the 76ers. Although the 76ers' original plan was to have Noel play during the 2013–14 season, Noel missed the entire season as he recovered from knee surgery. In July 2014, Noel joined the Philadelphia 76ers for the 2014 NBA Summer League. In game one of the 76ers' Orlando Summer League schedule, Noel played his first minutes of professional basketball, scoring a game-high 19 points in the 76ers' 83–77 loss to the Orlando Magic.

In just under 35 minutes of action as a starter, he recorded 6 points on 2-of-11 shooting, along with 10 rebounds and 3 blocks. Two days later, the 76ers exercised their third-year team option on Noel's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season. Later that day, he recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds, 3 blocks, 2 assists and 1 steal in a loss to Milwaukee Bucks. On January 30, he recorded 14 points, 6 rebounds, 4 steals, and a then career-high 6 blocks in a 103–94 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Participating in the 2015 Rising Stars Challenge on February 13, Noel recorded 4 points and 4 rebounds as Team USA were defeated by Team World, 121–112. On February 20, Noel recorded 12 points, 9 rebounds, 4 steals, and a career-high 9 blocks in a loss to the Indiana Pacers.

On October 30, 2015, the 76ers exercised their fourth-year team option on Noel's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season. On December 30, he recorded a season-high 20 points and 9 rebounds in a 110–105 win over the Sacramento Kings. On February 11, he was ruled out of the 2016 Rising Stars Challenge due to tendinitis in his right knee. On October 22, 2016, Noel was ruled out for three to five weeks due to an inflamed plica above his left knee that required surgery. After spending time with the Delaware 87ers of the NBA Development League on injury rehab assignments in late November and early December, Noel made his season debut for the 76ers on December 11 against the Detroit Pistons, having missed the first 23 games. He scored eight points in 10 minutes off the bench before leaving the game in the second quarter with a left ankle sprain. Even before he returned to the team, Noel was particularly vocal about the log-jam the 76ers had at the center position with him as well as Joel Embiid, Jahlil Okafor, and Richaun Holmes competing for time on the court. In his second game back from injury, Noel posted just eight minutes against the Los Angeles Lakers, much to his frustration. Noel expressed his dissatisfaction with his limited role in a post-game conference, lamenting ""I'm not an eight-minute player. So I don't know what that's about. I don't really care [who he's paired with]. I need to be on the court playing basketball. I'm too good to be playing eight minutes right now — that's crazy... Need to figure this [stuff] out"". Following a matchup against the Brooklyn Nets in which Noel did not play, coach Brett Brown announced Noel would not participate in the 76ers regular rotation for the foreseeable future while emphasizing the move was unrelated to Noel's recent disagreements with the team. Contrary to Brown's statement, Noel returned two games later, and assumed a backup role behind Embiid as Okafor recovered from a right knee injury. On January 24, 2017, while making his first start of the season in place of the injured Joel Embiid, Noel scored a season-high 19 points and had three blocked shots in a 121–110 win over the Los Angeles Clippers.

On March 3, 2017, in his first start for the Mavericks, Noel tied a career high with 17 rebounds while scoring 15 points in a 104–100 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. On June 23, 2017, the Mavericks tendered a $4.1 million qualifying offer to make Noel a restricted free agent. On August 26, 2017, he accepted the one-year, $4.1 million qualifying offer, officially re-signing with the Mavericks two days later. In the Mavericks' season opener on October 18, 2017, Noel had 16 points, his most since joining Dallas, and 11 rebounds in a 117–111 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On December 8, 2017, he underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left thumb. He subsequently missed 42 games, returning to action on February 28, 2018 against the Oklahoma City Thunder, recording four points, three rebounds and four fouls in 16 minutes in a 111–110 overtime loss.

He saw the court in 32 contests during the 2015–16 Pro A season, scoring 1.3 points per game, and he was named the league's Best Young Player. In the 2016–17 season, Ntilikina became a key part of the Strasbourg team, as he appeared in 45 games for the team while averaging 19.3 minutes per game. His successful campaign led him to winning his second straight Pro A Best Young Player award. In April 2017, Ntilikina entered his name into the 2017 NBA draft. By 12 June NBA Draft entry deadline, he became one of only 10 international underclassmen to remain in the NBA Draft that year. Ntilikina also became one of 20 invites for the green room on draft night.

After that night, he played his last game with SIG Strasbourg with them losing the LNB Pro A Finals to Élan Chalon. During the build-up to the Draft, there was heavy speculation that the Dallas Mavericks were thinking of selecting Ntilikina with the 9th overall pick. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was quoted as saying the Mavs wanted a 'pass-first point guard' and said 'We can maybe go a little bit more for a project', both of which Ntilikina fit the bill for. When the Knicks ended taking Ntilikina with the 8th pick, the Mavericks chose point guard Dennis Smith Jr. Ntilikina was also rumoured to be coveted by the Knicks' front office and coaching staff, with whom he met in person.

His rookie season in New York was considered by many as underwhelming, and was often claimed to be a draft bust. He was limited to 43 games in his second season due to injuries. Heading into his third season, Ntilikina was coming off a strong performance in the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. In the early part of the season, Ntilikina took over starting point guard duties and began to show great signs of defense. On 23 November 2019, Ntilikina racked up 6 steals in a 111–104 loss to San Antonio Spurs. However, like his previous two seasons, he struggled to shoot the ball and eventually was demoted in favor of Elfrid Payton.

He also represents the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team internationally. Born in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nurkić began playing basketball at 14 years of age, after Bosnian sports agent Enes Trnovčević took him to Slovenia and gave him an opportunity to play.He played in the youth categories for Slovenian team Zlatorog Laško.In February 2012, he was briefly loaned to Union Olimpija in order to play the Nike International Junior Tournament which was held in Belgrade. Nurkić attracted attention internationally by averaging 18.8 points and 11 rebounds over 5 games.Shortly after the tournament, he parted ways with Zlatorog Laško.Just days after, it was revealed that Nurkić was training with Croatian team Cedevita.In October 2012, after a few months of training with Croatian team Cedevita, Nurkić signed a four-year contract with the club.In his first season with Cedevita, he had a small role in the team under head coach Aleksandar Petrović, mostly playing in garbage time. In the Euroleague, he played only 6 games, averaging 1.8 points per game. In January 2013, Nurkić was loaned to Zadar until the end of the season on his initiative, hoping to play more minutes.In his second season, under new head coach Jasmin Repeša, he had breakthroughs in the regional Adriatic League, averaging 11.6 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, for only 16.3 minutes spent in the court. This was attributed mainly to foul troubles and conditioning issues. In 2014, Nurkić was nominated for the FIBA Europe Young Player of the Year Award. On 26 June 2014, Nurkić was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the 16th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft. He was later traded to the Denver Nuggets on draft night. On 31 July 2014, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Nuggets. On 29 October 2014, he made his NBA debut, recording 5 points and 7 rebounds in an 89–79 win over the Detroit Pistons.

Two days later, he recorded his second career double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds to go with 5 blocks in a 114–85 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. He went on to record two more double-doubles in February. Nurkić was named a participant in the 2015 Rising Stars Challenge as a replacement for Steven Adams of the Oklahoma City Thunder, but declined to play in the event for personal reasons. In the Nuggets' final game of the season on 15 April, he scored a season-high 17 points in a loss to the Golden State Warriors. On 20 May, he underwent successful surgery to repair a partially torn left patellar tendon. On 11 October 2015, the Nuggets exercised their third-year team option on Nurkić's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season.

On 8 April, he scored a career-high 21 points in a 102–98 win over the San Antonio Spurs. In the Nuggets' 2016–17 season opener on 26 October 2016, Nurkić set a new career high with 23 points in a 107–102 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Five days later, he grabbed a career-high 18 rebounds in a 105–102 loss to the Toronto Raptors. After Nikola Jokić emerged as Denver's starting center, Nurkić was demoted to the bench.

He played his freshman season of college for the 2014–15 Duke national championship team. He was selected with the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He has previously played in the NBA for the 76ers and Brooklyn Nets. Okafor had been heavily recruited before high school and was at the top of the recruiting rankings for several years.He played high school basketball in Chicago, Illinois for Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, where he earned high school national player of the year awards from McDonald's, USA Today and Parade. At the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Cup, he earned the Tournament MVP for the gold-medal winning USA team. In 2013, Okafor led Whitney Young to the 2013 Chicago Public High School League (CPL) city championship. He was an All-American as a junior in 2013. The following summer, he was an All-Tournament team selection at the 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, for the gold-medal Team USA.

In the week following Duke's victory in the championship game of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Wisconsin, Okafor announced that he would enter the NBA draft. Okafor was born in Chicago.His father, Chukwudi, known as Chuck, is of Nigerian Igbo and African-American descent, and his mother, Dacresha Lanett Benton, was African-American and white.As a youth, Okafor split time between his mother's home in the town of Moffett, Oklahoma and his father's home in Chicago. When he was 9 years old, his mother contracted bronchitis and died two weeks later from a collapsed lung. Okafor permanently moved in with his father to the South Side of Chicago and then to Rosemont.Okafor attended Rosemont Elementary.The adjustment was difficult because he was shy and so tall that other students thought he was put in the class for having failed.In November 2008, during seventh grade he matched his father's height of 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m). Later the family moved to Chicago's North Side so that Okafor could attend Whitney Young High School.As a 6-foot-7-inch (2.01 m) eighth-grader, Okafor was recruited by DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball in violation of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recruiting rules when DePaul Athletic Director Jean Lenti Ponsetto made public comments about an offer.

On December 22, in front of an audience that included John Calipari, Rick Pitino, Derrick Rose and Anthony Davis at the UIC Pavilion, Okafor had 20 points (10 in the fourth quarter), 9 rebounds and 3 blocked shots against cross-town rival Simeon and its star Parker in a 62–55 loss.

In January 2012 during his sophomore season, he was ranked third in the class by ESPNU. By April, he was ranked second. By the end of his second year, there was talk that with Jabari Parker Chicago might produce the number one high school player in the country in back to back years, something that they had come close to with Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas in the late 1970s. Also in the 1981 NBA draft Aguirre and Thomas were selected first and second, respectively. On October 25, 2012, Andrew Wiggins reclassified into the class of 2013, which cleared the way for Okafor to assume the number one ranking in the Rivals.com ranking for the class of 2014. As of November 2012, he was listed number one in the national class of 2014 by Rivals.com and number two by ESPN. He remained number one according to Rivals with its March 14, 2013 rankings update, following his junior season. Okafor played one season of college basketball for Duke. He was selected as Preseason Player of the Year by CBSSports.com, NBCSports.com, SB Nation, and ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla. Okafor was a Preseason All-American first team selection by USA Today, CBSSports.com, NBCSports.com, Athlon Sports, Bleacher Report, Sporting News, SB Nation, Sports Illustrated, and the Associated Press. In its preseason top 100 player ranking, Okafor was listed at number 3 by ESPN. For the 2014–15 Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball season, the conference media selected him as the ACC Preseason Rookie of the Year and as a Preseason All-ACC Team selection. He finished second in the conference Preseason Player of the Year voting to Marcus Paige. He was also listed as a John R. Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 candidate.

He was named USBWA National Freshman of the Year and the 2015 USBWA Freshman All-America Team by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). Okafor was a unanimous 2015 NCAA Men's Basketball All-American first-team selection by The Sporting News, USBWA, National Association of Basketball Coaches, and Associated Press. He contributed to a national championship with 10 points, including 2 key baskets in the final minutes, in the championship game of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, despite spending much of the game in foul trouble while defending Frank Kaminsky of Wisconsin. Okafor finished as runner-up to Kaminsky in the John R. Wooden Award voting (3385–3060). On April 9, Okafor declared for the 2015 NBA draft. On June 25, 2015, Okafor was selected with the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. After debuting with a 20-point NBA Summer League performance on July 6, Okafor signed a two-year contract with the 76ers on July 7, with team options for two additional seasons. He debuted for the 76ers with a 26-point, 7-rebound, 2-block effort (that also included 8 turnovers) against the Boston Celtics on October 28. The young 2015–16 76ers team played no players over the age of 24 or with more than three years of NBA experience on opening night. On November 9, he posted his first career double-double with 21 points and 15 rebounds against his hometown Chicago Bulls. In the subsequent game on November 11, Okafor posted 4 blocked shots along with 21 points and 7 rebounds against the Toronto Raptors. After the 76ers got off to an 0–16 start to the season, Okafor was involved in a street fight with taunting individuals on November 25 in Boston. On November 30, with additional reports surfacing that Okafor had been involved in various controversial and dangerous off-the-court situations, the 76ers agreed to a request to assign a security guard to accompany Okafor in public. On December 1, Okafor and the 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 103–91. The win ended the longest losing streak in the history of major professional sports in the United States (28 games going back to the prior season) and the worst start in NBA history (tied with the 2009–10 New Jersey Nets at 0–18). The next day, video surfaced on TMZ of a second fight in Boston from November. Okafor was subsequently suspended by the 76ers for two games. He returned from suspension against the San Antonio Spurs on December 7, recording 10 points and 4 rebounds off the bench in a 119–68 defeat. On January 16, 2016, he recorded 25 points and 10 rebounds in a 114–89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, helping the 76ers snap a four-game losing streak and improving their record to 5–37. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup. In February, the 76ers had Okafor and Nerlens Noel swap positions as Okafor moved from center to power forward. On February 6, he recorded 22 points and a season-high 17 rebounds in a 103–98 win over the Brooklyn Nets. The position swap was considered an improvement over the two players splitting time or having Noel play out of his natural position. On February 21 against the Dallas Mavericks, Okafor posted a career-high 31 points in a 129–103 loss, surpassing not only his NBA career high, but also his 30-point game at Duke. On February 28, Okafor posted 26 points against the Orlando Magic, but he endured a shin contusion in a collision with teammate Isaiah Canaan that was only expected to sideline him for a game. As he missed his fifth consecutive game, 76ers head coach Brett Brown noted that Okafor had a CT scan on his knee. On March 11, Okafor was ruled out for the rest of the season after tests revealed that he had sustained a small tear of the meniscus in his right knee. Okafor finished fifth in the 2016 NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting and earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors. After the first week of the 2016–17 NBA season, the 76ers exercised the third-year team option on Okafor's rookie scale contract. Okafor began the season on a 16-minute cap to be played over ""smaller segments"" and restriction from back-to-back game participation following the re-aggravation of his meniscus injury. His cap was soon raised to 24 minutes. He was cleared to play unrestricted prior to the November 21 contest against the Miami Heat. On January 14, 2017, Okafor, who hadn't played in the 76ers' previous three games, had a then season-high 26 points in a 109–93 loss to the Washington Wizards. He was selected to participate in the Rising Stars Challenge event during All-Star weekend. On February 25, 2017, he had a season-high 28 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a 110–109 loss to the New York Knicks. On March 31, 2017, after missing the previous four games, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with right knee soreness. On November 1, 2017, Okafor revealed that he would welcome a trade or buyout from the 76ers, after the team decided to not pick up the fourth-year, $6.3 million option on Okafor's rookie deal, after having tried to trade him for some time. Once the 76ers decided not to pick up Okafor's option, it gave him the right to be a free agent following the season. Furthermore, the team decided to build around Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons as Okafor saw time in only two games in the first 5 weeks of the season. The 76ers were unable to reach a satisfactory trade with another team for the soon-to-be free agent, despite the team's asking price dropping further and further down, leaving Okafor in a frustrating position of suddenly being benched for the season, since the 76ers would not buy him out and release him. It was later revealed that Okafor, along with several others associated with the 76ers, had been the subject of a disinformation campaign by the wife of then-General Manager Bryan Colangelo, using confidential information from the GM to denigrate Okafor and excuse the team's unwillingness to trade him. On December 7, 2017, Okafor was traded, along with Nik Stauskas and a 2019 second round draft pick, to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Trevor Booker. In his debut for the Nets on December 15, 2017 (his 22nd birthday), Okafor had 10 points and four rebounds in 23 minutes in a 120–87 loss to the Toronto Raptors. He had played just 25 minutes all season for the 76ers. Following his debut, the Nets decided to get him back into playing shape before putting him in games again. His next game came on January 3 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, where he scored two points in 11 minutes. Three days later, he had 12 points in 13 minutes in an 87–85 loss to the Boston Celtics. On January 27, he scored a team-high 21 points in a 111–97 loss to the Timberwolves. Following the season, he became an unrestricted free agent. On August 9, 2018, Okafor signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 19, he posted a season-high 17 points in 13 minutes against the Milwaukee Bucks. On January 19, the Pelicans announced that Anthony Davis endured an index finger sprain that would sideline him 1–2 weeks. With the increased playing time Okafor set sequential season-high totals in a January 21 105–85 win over the Memphis Grizzlies (season-high 20 points and season-high-tying 10 rebounds), a January 26 126–114 loss to the San Antonio Spurs (24 points and 15 rebounds), and a January 29 121–116 win over the Houston Rockets (27 points) with 12 rebounds. On January 23, he posted a career-high 6 blocks against the Detroit Pistons. On January 28, 2020, Okafor announced that he would change his number from 8 to honor Kobe Bryant. In October 2010, he successfully tried out for USA Basketball's 2011–12 USA Developmental National Team. In June 2011, he qualified for the 12-man United States team at the 2011 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship along with Simeon rivals Parker and Nunn. In the gold medal game, Okafor made all of his field goal attempts posting 18 points and 14 rebounds. For the tournament, his 46 rebounds over 5 games ranked him second on the United States team (to Aaron Gordon) and third at the Championships in rebounding. He was a member of USA Basketball's 12-man Team USA at the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Cup with Parker and Nunn again. His listed height was 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m). At a two-game four-team preliminary exhibition tournament in Las Palmas, Canary Islands the week before the championship began, he was named tournament MVP. He was also named the MVP of the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Cup, for the gold medal-winning United States team. Okafor posted 17 points and 8 rebounds in the gold medal game. Over the course of the tournament, he was the second-leading scorer, with 13.6 points per game, and second-leading rebounder for the United States, with 8.2 rebounds per game. On May 21, 2013, USA Basketball announced the roster of 24 players, including Okafor, who had accepted invitations to the June 14–19, 2013, USA Basketball Men's U19 World Cup team training camp. The camp was used to select the 12-man team for the June 27 – July 7, 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Czech Republic. Okafor made the final roster that was announced on June 18. The team won the gold medal, and Okafor made the All-Tournament team, along with teammate and tournament MVP Gordon. He led the tournament with 77% field goal percentage, and he was the only player on the All-Tournament Team who would return to high school. However, coaches Billy Donovan and Shaka Smart told him his weak link was his conditioning. His mother, Dacresha Lanett Benton,died when he was 9 years old, leaving him to be raised by his father Chukwudi and aunt Chinyere Okafor-Conley,whom he refers to as his ""auntie mom.""

With Pau-Orthez, Okobo reached the playoffs as the eight-seed. On May 23, during Game 1 of the series against first-seeded Monaco, Okobo scored a career-high 44 points in a 99–97 loss.

He became a first-time NBA All-Star, led the league in steals, was named to the All-Defensive First Team and the All-NBA Third Team, and won the NBA Most Improved Player Award in his first season with Indiana. Despite an injury-riddled 2018–19 season, including a season-ending injury in January 2019, Oladipo was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve for the second straight year. Oladipo is also a singer, having released an EP, Songs for You in 2017 and his debut album V.O. in 2018.Oladipo was a contestant in season two of The Masked Singer, dressed as the 'Thingamajig'.

After defeating VCU in the third round, the Hoosiers lost in the Sweet Sixteen to Kentucky, the eventual national champions. In the 2012-13 season, despite an Indiana roster deep with talent, Oladipo emerged as one of the nation's biggest stars. Midway through the season, ESPN reporter Eamonn Brenann wrote, ""In 2½ seasons in Bloomington, Oladipo has morphed from a raw athletic specimen to a defensive specialist/energy glue guy – he became a hit with IU fans for holding his hand in front of his face after dunks at home, typically after a steal he himself created – into a sudden, stunning, bona fide collegiate star."" Due in part to Oladipo's leadership, the Indiana Hoosiers finished the 2012–13 season as the outright Big Ten champions. At the end of the regular season, Oladipo ranked fourth in the country in field goal percentage (61.4), on pace to have the highest field goal percentage by any guard since the 1996–97 season.

He was projected as a top-15 pick by ESPN and CBS Sports. Oladipo was invited to sit in the ""green room"" during the draft and was selected second overall by the Orlando Magic, later signing his rookie-scale contract with the Magic on July 8. When the 2013 rookie class convened for its annual photo shoot and filled out its NBA.com Rookie Survey, the class voted Oladipo as the best defender, the co-favorite 2013–14 Rookie of the Year (with C. J. McCollum), the co-favorite to have the best career (with Kelly Olynyk) and second-most athletic (behind Tony Mitchell). On December 3, 2013, Oladipo recorded his first career triple-double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a double overtime loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. Rookie Michael Carter-Williams of the 76ers also recorded his first career triple-double in the same game, marking the first and only time in NBA history that two rookies have recorded triple-doubles in the same game. The last time that two players had recorded their first career triple-doubles in the same game was when Detroit Pistons' pair Donnie Butcher and Ray Scott did it on March 14, 1964 (they were not rookies). It was also the first time that two opponents had recorded triple-doubles in the same game since Caron Butler and Baron Davis had done so on November 23, 2007.

Coming off the bench for the Pacers, he scored 9 points in 21 minutes of playing time, including a game-tying three-pointer, in an overtime win over the Chicago Bulls. Oladipo is a shooting guard who is also capable of playing point guard. Indiana coach Tom Crean would frequently attribute Oladipo's success to his extreme work ethic and pre-game preparation of reviewing film. Oladipo is known for entertaining fans with exciting dunks. As announcer Clark Kellogg noted, ""Victor Oladipo is like a baby's bottom, smooth and sometimes... explosive."" On offense, Oladipo is capable of aggressively and quickly driving to the basket, aided by his leaping ability. Following a victory by Indiana over #1 ranked Michigan, coach John Beilein remarked, ""I've seen a lot of players. I don't know whether I've seen one quicker or faster, more athletic, than Oladipo. It's tough to stay in front of him."" His offensive proficiency improved as his outside shooting range improved each year of his collegiate career. On defense, Oladipo has been described as a ""lockdown off-ball defender who can defend multiple positions"". He has the quickness to guard point guards and the strength and athleticism to guard a forward if caught in a mismatch. His athleticism and anticipation makes it hard to set a screen on him. He also rebounds well at his position.",26508,3208,2019-20,7.0,4.0,175.0,5.8,17.5,0.329,2.1,8.4,0.244,3.7,9.1,0.409,2.5,3.1,0.8,1.2,1.6,2.9,4.1,0.8,0.2,2.5,1.9,16.0,12.0,Indiana Pacers

Following the season, he was featured in a May cover story in Sports Illustrated with the title ""The Best High School Basketball Player Since LeBron James is...Jabari Parker But There's Something More Important To Him Than Instant NBA Stardom: His Faith"". The story presented his humility and noted that he is conflicted on his decision to serve as an LDS missionary.Parker announced that he anticipated trimming his potential schools to a list of five by the end of the summer so that he could plan official visits.

They were the only two players to appear on every ballot. However, Parker was selected as the ESPN HS National Junior of the Year and the MaxPreps.com National Junior of the Year. He was selected as a first team ESPN HS boys' high school basketball All-American along with Kyle Anderson, Marcus Smart, Shabazz Muhammad and Nerlens Noel by ESPN HS.

Parker entered the summer of 2012 as the consensus number one player in the country until he was sidelined with a foot injury, which caused him to miss some games during the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship. Parker was one of ten USA Today preseason All-USA selections, and his team was ranked No. 1 preseason nationally by MaxPreps.com. On December 20, 2012, he chose to play for Duke. Over the course of his senior season, Parker and Simeon played in six showcase games that required travel outside of the region. Three of the showcase games were broadcast nationally on one of the ESPN networks.

Preseason honors included preseason All-American first team listings by Sporting News and USA Today, and being named the preseason ACC Rookie of the Year. Parker was also one of nine freshmen named to the 50-man Wooden Award preseason watchlist.

On November 13, Parker earned his second Sports Illustrated cover as part of a four-version set of regional covers depicting college basketball's greatest rivalries on the College Basketball Preview Issue. On November 12 in the Champions Classic at his hometown United Center, Parker posted 27 points, 9 rebounds, 1 assist, 2 steals, and 1 block in a losing effort against Wiggins's Kansas Jayhawks.

On March 8, in the second Carolina–Duke rivalry game of the season, Parker had a career high 30 points. On March 10, he earned a record-tying (Kenny Anderson and Tyler Hansbrough) tenth ACC rookie of the week honor in the final week of the regular season. In postseason play, Parker yielded a 20-point performance in the semifinals of the 2014 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament against NC State on March 15, which marked his 17th such effort and moved him into sole possession of second place on the ACC freshman list, ahead of Marbury. In the March 16 championship game against Virginia, Parker posted his 18th 20-point game, which was one short of Anderson's ACC freshman record.

On June 26, Parker was selected no. 2 overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. Just prior to the draft, Parker signed a shoe endorsement deal with the Jordan Brand. On July 9, 2014, Parker signed with the Bucks and joined them for the 2014 NBA Summer League. In the 2014–15 NBA.com Rookie Survey at the annual Rookie Photo Shoot on August 6, Parker was named by his peers as both the most likely to be Rookie of the Year and the most likely to have the best NBA career. On October 29, 2014, Parker made his NBA debut in the Bucks' season opener against the Charlotte Hornets. In just under 37 minutes of action as a starter, he recorded 8 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal in a 108–106 overtime loss. Two nights later in his first home game, he posted a double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds against the Philadelphia 76ers. On November 19, he posted a season-high 23 points in a triple-overtime win over the Brooklyn Nets. Parker was selected as the October/November Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month. On December 15, Parker suffered a season-ending injury by tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) against the Phoenix Suns. Parker's injury extended into the beginning of the 2015–16 NBA season. He returned to action on November 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the fifth game of the season for the Bucks but struggled, posting just two points in 16 minutes as a starter. As he ramped up his activity, he was rested on the second of back-to-back games. Nonetheless, after five games, he endured a sprain in his talonavicular joint in the right mid-foot causing him to be expected to miss several games. He only missed one game. The following week, he began to come off the bench while O. J. Mayo took his starting spot. On December 12, Parker had a 19-point, 7-rebound, 2-steal performance against the Golden State Warriors to help end their 24-game win streak. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup. On February 19, he tied his career high with 23 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. He surpassed that total the following night, recording career highs of 28 points and 13 rebounds in a 117–109 double-overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks. On February 29, Parker set a new career high with 36 points in a 128–121 Bucks victory over the Houston Rockets. On January 15, 2017, Parker was one assist and one field goal shy of his first NBA triple-double against the Atlanta Hawks. February 9, Parker was ruled out for the rest of the 2016–17 season after an MRI revealed a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee. The recovery and rehabilitation period was estimated at 12 months. It was his second ACL tear in the same knee, the first having occurred in December 2014. For the season, he averaged 20.1 points (2nd on team), 6.2 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.0 steals in 33.9 minutes over 51 games before the injury. On December 18, 2017, the Bucks assigned Parker to their NBA G League affiliate, the Wisconsin Herd, so that he could practice while completing his recovery. After two workouts with the Herd, Parker was recalled by the Bucks on December 19. On February 2, 2018, Parker made his first appearance for the Bucks since February 9, 2017, scoring 12 points in a 92–90 win over the New York Knicks. He made 4 of 7 shots over nearly 15 minutes as a reserve. On February 27, 2018, he scored a season-high 19 points in a 107–104 loss to the Washington Wizards. On March 21, 2018, he scored a season-high 20 points in 30 minutes (the most he'd played since rejoining the team) in a 127–120 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On April 1, he posted a season-high 35 points along with 10 rebounds in an overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. It marked the first time all season that Parker played more than a few seconds over his 30-minute cap since his return to the lineup. Following the 2017–18 NBA season, the Bucks made Parker a qualifying offer, giving them the right to match an offer sheet within 48 hours. The Bucks later retracted the qualifying offer, allowing Parker and the Chicago Bulls to agree a contract. On July 14, 2018, Parker signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the Chicago Bulls. He debuted with the Bulls on October 18 with 15 points and 5 rebounds off the bench against the Philadelphia 76ers. Four days later, he scored a season-high 20 points off the bench against the Dallas Mavericks. On November 21, Parker posted 20 points and 13 rebounds against the Phoenix Suns, but his eight assists left him two short of his first career triple-double. In early December, soon after Jim Boylen took over the head coaching position from Fred Hoiberg, the Bulls dropped Parker from their rotation, no longer giving him regular minutes. This was also about the time that Bobby Portis returned to the lineup on December 10, after sitting out nearly seven weeks. Parker posted 22 points on January 29 against the Brooklyn Nets. On February 6, 2019, Parker was traded, along with Bobby Portis and a 2023 second-round pick, to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Otto Porter. Parker posted career highs with 14 rebounds on February 27 against the Brooklyn Nets. and 15 rebounds on March 27 against the Phoenix Suns. Washington declined the team option on what would have been Parker's 2nd year with the team, which would have yielded Parker $20 million. On July 11, 2019, Parker signed with the Atlanta Hawks. On January 7, 2020, it was announced that Parker would be out at least two weeks with a shoulder injury. On February 6, 2020, Parker was traded to the Sacramento Kings. In October 2010, Parker was among the 18 players who participated in the 2011–12 USA Developmental National Team mini-camp giving him an automatic invitation to the June 10–18, 2011 tryouts for FIBA U16 competition at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Parker was one of four Chicago products to emerge from the 27-man tryouts as part of the 12-man team. He was MVP of the 2011 FIBA Americas U16 Championship, where Team USA won a gold medal. This qualified the United States for the 2012 FIBA U17 World Championship. The team, which was coached by Don Showalter of Mid-Prairie High School, scored over 100 points in each outing. Parker set the USA U16 single-game scoring record of 27 points. In December 2011, he was named USA Basketball's Male Athlete of the Year based on his FIBA Americas performance, which made him the youngest winner ever. While on the stage to accept the award from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, he claims that he told the mayor ""I hope they don't boo me."" He was selected for the USA team that competed in the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship in Kaunas, Lithuania from June 29 – July 8, 2012 along with Simeon teammate Kendrick Nunn and Whitney Young rival Okafor. The team won the gold medal, although Parker missed some games, including the semifinal, with an ankle injury. Parker was frequently compared to Derrick Rose in high school. According to Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael O'Brien, as of November 2011, Rose had a 3–0 advantage in defining moments: ""the back-to-back dunks against Washington in the city championship at the United Center, the game-winning shot in overtime to give Simeon the state championship against Peoria Richwoods and the dismantling of Oak Hill, the top-ranked team in the country."" Rose's game against the Oak Hill team with Brandon Jennings, Nolan Smith and Alex Legion on ESPN is described as Rose's national introduction. Although there are comparisons to Rose, his game is most often compared to Grant Hill and Paul Pierce. Dime Magazine describes him as ""Grant Hill with a jump shot"". Parker claims to model his game after Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony. He hopes to be regarded as the best high school basketball player in the history of the city of Chicago and has stated that ""being compared to Derrick also drives me. I know if I get better than him or break the records he broke I could be one of the best players to come out of Chicago. I look forward to being one of those players."" Because of the title of the Sports Illustrated story that compared Parker to LeBron James, Mike DeCourcy of Sporting News stated that ""Jabari Parker is, rather, the best [high school basketball player] since Greg Oden."" In addition, Parker was considered to have a much less developed physique than James at the same stage of development. CBS Sports' Jeff Borzello also contested the proclamation, pointing out that since James's 2003 class both Dwight Howard (2004) and Oden (2006) were consensus top players in their classes and that Parker might not be any better than the most recent consensus, Oden. In addition, CBS noted that Parker ""might not even be the best high school basketball player in the country, given the development of class of 2014's Andrew Wiggins."" Chicago Tribune writer Mike Helfgot described the Sports Illustrated comparison as ""incredibly irresponsible journalism"", noting he had once worked for the Star-Ledger when it described Derrick Caracter as the next James. Following his four consecutive championships with Simeon, Parker (and Chicago's Simeon) were compared to McClain (and Peoria's Manual). Peoria's Journal Star emphasized that McClain was 32–0 as a starter in IHSA play because in the 1994–97 time period the IHSA was only divided into two classes. Thus, Manual had to wade through an 8-round tournament instead of the 7-round modern 4-class format. However, Simeon won 6 of its 7 games in its final championship by more than 10 points, while Manual only won 3 of its 8 by such a margin. In the postgame press conference, Simeon Coach Smith emphasized that his team had to endure the pressure of playing a national schedule that included games against elite teams in distant venues. Note, that with the 4-class system rather than the 2-class system of the past, the 2013 Class 3A IHSA champion was CPL runner-up Morgan Park, who split 2 neutral court 2013 games with Simeon. As noted above, Rose-era Simeon teams only won 2 championships in the 2-class era. Adding Parker's 55-11 start to a 33–1 junior year and a 30–3 senior season gives him a 118–15 legacy compared to Rose's 120–12. Parker is of Tongan and African American descent. His parents are Folola ""Lola"" Finau-Parker and Sonny Parker. His father, Sonny, a Chicago native, played for the Texas A&M Aggies before becoming a 1976 NBA Draft first round selection (17th overall) by the Golden State Warriors.He played in the NBA for six seasons. Sonny was an NBA teammate of former Washington Huskies men's basketball head coach Lorenzo Romar.In 2013, he developed a kidney disease that requires dialysis, making it difficult for him to attend Jabari's games. His mother, Lola, a Polynesian native of Tonga, is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and emigrated to Salt Lake City at age three.Her grandfather was the second Tongan baptized by LDS missionaries.Several of Lola's cousins are National Football League athletes, including Harvey Unga, Haloti Ngata and Tony Moeaki, and one of her first cousins once removed, Tony Finau, made his PGA Tour debut in October 2014. His parents met at a mall when she was a student at Brigham Young University and he was playing for the Warriors.After helping him find a dress shirt, Sonny left her tickets to his game.After he retired and she served her mission, they married and settled in Chicago.The family lives in the South Shore community area where his parents settled after marryingand has turned down two movie offers.Parker has six siblings.

At the time of his sixteenth birthday, he became a LDS priest (as is customary in his faith). He has both performed baptisms and administered the weekly sacrament.In addition, he regularly traveled with his bishop during his monthly visitations to comfort the sick, the poor and the elderly.Parker worked out with basketball trainer Tim Grover.Jabari prefers individual training sessions with his brother Darryl instead of playing pick-up games. Following his sophomore year, ESPN reported that he had a 3.4 grade point average.By the end of the first semester of his junior year, The New York Times reported his GPA was 3.7.By April of his junior year, his GPA was 3.63, ranking 18th in his class of 377 and his extracurricular activities includes service as the principal-appointed president of student representatives to the local school council, a youth basketball instructor, and a volunteer for Operation PUSH, The Salvation Army, and the New Beginnings Church.

During his high school career, Patterson helped lead Huntington High School to three-straight state championships.

Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Patterson was listed as the No. 3 power forward and the No. 17 player in the nation in 2007,and was named a McDonald's All-American. Patrick Patterson played college basketball for the University of Kentucky. He chose to play for Kentucky rather than Duke or Florida in a highly publicized recruiting battle. He was recruited by Kentucky coach Tubby Smith and his replacement Billy Gillispie.In the 2009–10 season he played for former Memphis coach John Calipari who became Billy Gillispie's replacement in April 2009. During Patterson's freshman All-American 2007–08 season, he averaged 16.4 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and 0.8 steals, while shooting 57% from the field.

Patterson scored a career-high 33 points on December 22, 2008 against the Tennessee State Tigers. During Patterson's sophomore 2008–09 season, he averaged 17.9 points, 9.3 rebounds, 2.1 blocks and 0.6 steals, while shooting 60% from the field. On April 18, 2009, Patterson decided to enter his name into the 2009 NBA draft. However, on May 8, 2009, Patrick decided he would return to Kentucky for the third season. Patterson continued to play a crucial role for the team during his junior season. However, with the addition of freshman players John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins and Eric Bledsoe, Patterson was no longer required to be the main option for scoring and rebounding. Patterson also improved his outside shot, shooting about 35% from the 3-point line all season (compared to no 3-pointers made in the previous seasons). During this season, Patterson helped the team win the SEC Tournament and achieve a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2004. On April 23, 2010, Patterson entered the 2010 NBA draft; by the time of the draft, he had completed his coursework and earned a degree from UK.On June 24, 2010, Patterson was selected in the NBA draft by the Houston Rockets with the fourteenth overall pick. On November 10, he was assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League.In nine games with the Vipers, Patterson averaged 35 minutes, 18.3 points, and 10.3 rebounds.Two days after being recalled by the Rockets, he made his NBA regular season debut on December 15, 2010. With Luis Scola injured, Patterson had his first NBA start with the Rockets on March 14, 2011, scoring 2 points and grabbing 5 rebounds. After the Rockets used the amnesty clause to waive Scola, Patterson became the starting power forward for the 2012-13 season. On February 20, 2013, Patterson was traded to the Sacramento Kings along with Toney Douglas and Cole Aldrich in exchange for Thomas Robinson, Francisco García and Tyler Honeycutt. On December 9, 2013, the Kings traded Patterson, along with Greivis Vásquez, John Salmons, and Chuck Hayes to the Toronto Raptors for Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy, and Aaron Gray. On July 12, 2014, Patterson re-signed with the Raptors to a reported three-year, $18 million contract. On July 10, 2017, Patterson signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder. On August 10, 2017, he underwent a successful arthroscopic procedure on his left knee. On August 1, 2019, Patterson and the Thunder agreed to a buyout, allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent. It was soon later reported of Patterson's intentions to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. On August 16, 2019, Patterson signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.",26521,3302,2019-20,45.0,18.0,578.0,4.4,11.1,0.399,3.1,8.3,0.373,1.3,2.7,0.477,1.7,2.1,0.794,1.8,5.5,7.3,1.8,0.4,0.2,0.9,2.5,13.6,13.0,Los Angeles Clippers

He has won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, an NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, two Olympic gold medals, and led the NBA in assists four times and steals six times. He has also been selected to ten NBA All-Star teams, eight All-NBA teams, and nine NBA All-Defensive teams. Paul was a McDonald's All-American in high school. He attended Wake Forest University for two years of college basketball, where he helped the Demon Deacons achieve their first-ever number one ranking. He was selected fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets, where he developed into one of the league's premier players, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting in 2008. During the 2011 offseason, Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, only for the transaction to be controversially voided by the NBA. Later that summer, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers instead. Behind Paul's playmaking, the Clippers developed a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, earning them the nickname ""Lob City"". In 2017, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, and helped the team win a franchise-record 65 games in his debut season. He was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Russell Westbrook on July 16, 2019. Off the court, Paul has served as the National Basketball Players Association president since August 2013. One of the highest-paid athletes in the world, he holds endorsement deals with companies such as Nike and State Farm. Paul was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to Charles Edward Paul and Robin Jones.He has an older brother named Charles ""C.J."" Paul.A former athlete himself, Charles Sr. taught his sons basketball and football and coached them in various youth leagues throughout their childhoods.Growing up, the Paul brothers spent their summers working at a service station owned by their grandfather, Nathanial Jones;Paul attributes many life lessons to his grandfather and describes him as his ""best friend"".Paul attended West Forsyth High School in Clemmons, North Carolina.During his freshman and sophomore seasons, he played on the junior varsity team. For his junior year, he averaged 25 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.4 steals per game, helping West Forsyth reach the state semifinals. Over the ensuing summer, he led the Winston-Salem-based Kappa Magic to the National U-17 AAU title, earning tournament MVP honors in the process. During his senior season, Paul received national attention for scoring 61 points in a game; his 61-year-old grandfather was slain earlier in the year and Paul honored him by scoring one point for each year of his life.Paul finished the season with averages of 30.8 points, 5.9 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and 6 steals per game, leading West Forsyth to a 27–3 record and the Class 4A Eastern Regional finals. He was then named a McDonald's All-American, first-team Parade All-American, and North Carolina's Mr. Basketball by The Charlotte Observer. As a freshman at Wake Forest University, Paul averaged 14.8 points, 5.9 assists, and 2.7 steals per game, setting school freshman records for three-point percentage, free throws, free throw percentage, assists, and steals in the process. Behind his play, the Demon Deacons qualified for the NCAA Tournament, losing in the Sweet Sixteen to St. Joseph's. At the conclusion of the season, Paul was named ACC Rookie of the Year and Third Team All-ACC. For two weeks early in Paul's sophomore season, Wake Forest was ranked number one in the nation for the first time in school history. In the final game of the year, Paul punched NC State guard Julius Hodge in the groin and received a one-game suspension for the ACC Tournament, an incident that marred Paul's image for a short time. The Demon Deacons again qualified for the NCAA Tournament but suffered a second round upset at the hands of West Virginia. With final averages of 15.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, Paul was eventually named First Team Consensus All-America, and with a 3.21 grade point average (GPA), he was also named to ESPN's Academic All-America Team. On April 15, 2005, he announced he would be hiring an agent and turning professional. On March 2, 2011, Wake Forest retired his jersey. Paul was selected fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets. Due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Hornets played most of their games in Oklahoma City in his first two seasons with the Hornets. Paul finished the season leading all rookies in points, assists, steals, and double-doubles, and became only the second rookie in NBA history to lead the league in total steals. With final averages of 16.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 2.2 steals per game,he was named NBA Rookie of the Year, falling just one vote shy of winning the award unanimously. The only other rookie to receive a first place vote was Deron Williams, with whom Paul enjoyed a brief rivalry early in their careers. At the 2007 All-Star Weekend, Paul set new Rookie Challenge records with 17 assists and 9 steals. For his sophomore season, he increased his scoring and passing averages to 17.3 points and 8.9 assists per game, but played in only 64 games due to injury.Paul was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game in 2007–08,playing in front of his home fans in New Orleans. Behind his leadership, the Hornets were near the top of the Western Conference standings all year, temporarily occupying first place on March 17 following a win against the Chicago Bulls. New Orleans finished the season with a franchise-record 56 wins and the second seed in the West. Paul led the NBA with 11.6 assists and 2.7 steals per game to go along with 21.1 points per game, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting and being named to his first All-NBA and All-Defensive teams. In his playoff debut, he scored 35 points against the Dallas Mavericks. In Game 2, he set a franchise playoff record with 17 assists. The Hornets defeated the Mavericks in five games, with Paul registering 24 points, 11 rebounds, and 15 assists in the final game. New Orleans were eliminated in the next round by the San Antonio Spurs. Prior to the start of the 2008–09 season, Paul signed a contract extension with the Hornets worth $68 million. On December 17, 2008, he set the NBA record for consecutive games with a steal at 106. On several occasions, he came within a few steals of recording a quadruple-double, including a 27-point, 10 rebound, 15 assist, and 7 steal game against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 26, 2009. His final averages were 22.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 11 assists, and 2.8 steals per game.Despite Paul's individual accomplishments, New Orleans' record fell from the year before and they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets. After a slow start to the 2009–10 season, the Hornets fired coach Byron Scott. Paul stirred up controversy when he announced his displeasure with the move, commenting that team management should have ""consulted with me and asked how I felt before it happened."" In early February 2010, Paul tore cartilage in his left knee and was sidelined for over a month by surgery, forcing him to miss the All-Star Game. In total, he played in only 45 games and his averages dropped to 18.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 10.7 assists, and 2.1 steals per game.Without Paul, the Hornets struggled, missing the playoffs. In 2010–11, Paul had another injury scare on March 6, 2011, suffering a concussion after colliding with Cavaliers guard Ramon Sessions and being carried off the court in a stretcher. He returned two games later, registering 33 points and 15 assists against the Sacramento Kings. With Paul playing a full season, the Hornets qualified for the playoffs and were matched up with the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. Paul had a ""historically great"" performance in the series, contributing 33 points, 14 assists, and 4 steals in Game 1 and 27 points, 13 rebounds, and 15 assists in Game 4. His final averages were 22 points, 6.7 rebounds, 11.5 assists, and 1.8 steals per game on 54.5 percent shooting.New Orleans were eliminated in six games, and ownership, fearing that Paul would leave the franchise via free agency, began actively pursuing a trade that would provide the team equitable compensation in return for his services. On December 8, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a three-team trade sending Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA, who owned the Hornets at the time, nullified the deal, with commissioner David Stern claiming New Orleans would be better off keeping Paul. The teams involved in the trade attempted to lobby the league to reverse its ruling and reconstruct the deal to no avail. On December 12, the Hornets agreed to a trade sending Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers, but the deal broke down after the NBA added additional demands to the original terms. Two days later, the teams finally made the trade, sending Paul and two future second round draft picks to the Clippers for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft. Upon the deal's completion, Paul announced that he would opt into the final year of his contract and remain in Los Angeles for at least two more seasons. Paul's arrival to Los Angeles rejuvenated the Clippers franchise, with teammate Blake Griffin later commenting, ""It put us on the map."" Early in Paul's debut season, the team developed a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, usually from Paul to Griffin or DeAndre Jordan, earning them the nickname ""Lob City"". Paul finished the year averaging 19.8 points, 9.1 assists, and 2.5 steals per game,becoming the first Clipper to be named to the All-NBA First Team since the franchise moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s. Behind his play and the emergence of Griffin as an All-NBA performer, Los Angeles qualified for the playoffs, losing to the San Antonio Spurs in the Conference Semifinals. At the 2013 All-Star Game, Paul led the West to victory with a 20-point and 15 assist performance, earning his first NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. He finished the season averaging 16.9 points, 9.7 assists, and 2.4 steals per game, helping the Clippers to a franchise-record 56 wins. Seeded fourth in the West entering the playoffs, Los Angeles were defeated in the first round by the Memphis Grizzlies. Shortly after their early postseason exit, the Clippers announced they would not renew coach Vinny Del Negro's contract and rumors arose of Paul forcing Del Negro out. Los Angeles later denied any player involvement in the coaching decision. Prior to the start of the 2013–14 season, Paul re-signed with the Clippers for five years on a contract worth approximately $107 million. Despite a shoulder injury that sidelined him for over a month, Los Angeles set another new franchise record for wins with 57. His final averages were 19.1 points, 10.7 assists, and 2.5 steals per game.In Game 1 of the second round of the playoffs, he hit a career postseason-high eight three-pointers to help the Clippers take an early series lead over the Oklahoma City Thunder. In Game 5 and with the series tied 2–2, he made a string of late mistakes leading to an eventual Thunder victory, later commenting, ""It's me ... Everything that happened at the end is on me."" Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Los Angeles in six games. In 2014–15, Paul played in all 82 games for the first time in his career, averaging 19.1 points and a league-high 10.2 assists per game. In Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs, he hit a go-ahead shot with a second left to lift the Clippers over the Spurs despite a hamstring injury. The injury forced him to miss the first two games of the next series versus the Houston Rockets, and Los Angeles eventually lost in seven games despite holding a 3–1 series lead. The defeat marked ten consecutive seasons and seven consecutive playoff appearances without a Conference Finals appearance for Paul. In January of the 2015–16 season, Paul led the Clippers on a ten-game winning streak despite missing Griffin and Jordan at various points due to injury. For the third straight year, he finished the season with averages of over 19 points, 10 assists, and 2 steals per game.To begin the postseason, the Clippers drew a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers, taking a 2–1 lead to start the series. In Game 4, Paul broke his hand and was ruled out indefinitely. Without Paul, as well as Griffin, who also injured himself in Game 4, Los Angeles eventually lost the series in six games. In 2016–17, Paul missed 21 regular season games due to rest or injury, and averaged 18.1 points, 9.2 assists, and 5 rebounds in just over 31 minutes per game.At season's end, Paul was not rewarded with an All-NBA honor, marking just the second time he failed to make an All-NBA team since 2008 and the first time in his six years as a Clipper. In the playoffs, Los Angeles was eliminated after their first round series against the Utah Jazz, with Paul averaging 25.3 points, 9.9 assists, 5 rebounds per game over seven games. On June 28, 2017, Paul was traded to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer, a future first round pick, and cash considerations. In his debut for the Rockets in their season opener on October 17, 2017, Paul had four points on 2-for-9 shooting in a 122–121 win over the Golden State Warriors. Paul sat on the bench down the stretch while the Rockets made their final push, and it was later revealed he was playing through a knee injury. He subsequently missed the next 14 games. He returned to the lineup on November 16 and had 11 points and 10 assists in a 142–116 win over the Phoenix Suns. On December 13, he recorded a then season-high 31 points, 11 assists, and seven rebounds in a 108–96 win over the Charlotte Hornets. Two days later, he had 28 points, eight assists, and seven steals to lead the Rockets to their 12th straight victory, a 124–109 win over the San Antonio Spurs. Paul became the first player in NBA history to post 28 points, eight assists, and seven steals in a game against the Spurs. In the previous 10 years, that stat line had been achieved just 10 times—six of those 10 recorded by Paul. He was subsequently named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played from Monday, December 11 through Sunday, December 17. It was his 13th career Player of the Week honor and his first since January 2016. On January 10, Paul took 29 shots and finished with a then season-high 37 points in a 121–112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

In Game 5 of the Rockets' second-round playoff series against the Jazz, Paul scored a playoff career-high 41 points with eight 3-pointers to reach the conference finals for the first time in his career, helping the Rockets eliminate the Jazz in five games with a 112–102 win. He also had 10 assists and seven rebounds. In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals, Paul injured his hamstring late in the game as the Rockets went up 3–2 in the series against the Warriors. With Paul out for Games 6 and 7, the Rockets were eliminated from the playoffs with back-to-back losses. On July 8, 2018, Paul signed a four-year, $160 million maximum contract extension with the Rockets. Paul received a two-game suspension early in the 2018–19 season for his involvement in an on-court fight against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 20. Additionally, Paul was fined a total of $491,782 for his role in the fracas. On December 11, he recorded a triple-double with 11 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a 111–104 win over the Trail Blazers. On December 20, he suffered a left hamstring strain against the Miami Heat. He subsequently missed 17 games, returning to action on January 27 against the Orlando Magic.

He debuted for the Thunder in a 100–95 loss to the Utah Jazz on October 23, 2019, putting up 22 points and 8 rebounds in 30 minutes of play. Paul made his debut for the United States national team at the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan. He finished the competition with a tournament-high 44 assists, helping Team USA win the bronze medal.

Paul was promoted to the starting point guard position for the 2012 Olympics in London, averaging 8.2 points, 5.1 assists, and 1.6 steals per game en route to another gold medal and undefeated tournament.

In his 2014 NBA preview, ESPN's Kevin Pelton called Paul the league's best point guard, adding, ""a title he's held throughout his career when healthy"". Paul prefers playing in the half court versus playing up-tempo. He creates scoring opportunities by constantly changing speeds; upon beating his defender one-on-one or shedding him in the pick-and-roll, he will often slow down and box him out, denying him from regaining front side position and forcing the defense to help at all times. His ability to penetrate deep into the paint leads to easy shots for his teammates, and in 2013, he was second in the league in assisted three-pointers. As a playmaker, he is noted for his consistently high assist-to-turnover ratio, averaging just 2.4 turnovers per game over his career.A deft midrange shooter, he is especially proficient from the right elbow, leading the league in shooting percentage from that area in 2015. On defense, he aggravates opponents with active hands and high effort, and has been ranked as one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA. Paul is represented by NBA agent Leon Rose of Creative Artists Agency, who also represents Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade, among others. In 2014, Forbes ranked Paul as one of the highest-paid athletes in the world with $24.2 million in earnings including $5.5 million in endorsements.

He was the cover athlete for the video game NBA 2K8. Paul was selected president of the National Basketball Players Association on August 21, 2013, after having served on the executive committee for four years. He was a key figure in the banning of Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the NBA following racist remarks Sterling made in 2014. In one interview, Paul mentioned a possible boycott if Sterling continued to own the team. Paul played a significant role in the election of Michele Roberts as the Executive Director of the Players Association, giving a strong recommendation to the executive committee responsible for filling the position. Paul married his college sweetheart, Jada Crawley, on September 10, 2011. Together they have two children, a son born in May 2009 and a daughter born in August 2012.

His sophomore season was injury free, although he broke the same bone (fifth metatarsal) in his right foot, which would cause him to miss the first 16 games of his junior season.While on the court, Pinson's passing, defense and leadership played a key role in the Tar Heels' run to consecutive Final Fours. Pinson was also acknowledged as a positive factor in the locker room for these teams, as he developed a reputation as a prankster in both the locker room and with the media.During the Tar Heels' 2017 championship run, Pinson's playmaking helped the team defeat Kentucky in the South Regional Final, as his full-court drive and pass set up a game-winning shot by forward Luke Maye.As a senior, he averaged 10.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.1 assists in 29.7 minutes per game.After going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, Pinson joined the Brooklyn Nets for the 2018 NBA Summer League.

As a freshman in 2009–10, he was a back-up forward for the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team's national championship team, playing with his older brother Miles. He was a 2009 McDonald's All-American in high school.During his senior year at Duke, he also played with his younger brother Marshall.

He earned a silver medal with the 2008 USA U18 National Team at the FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship.Plumlee was named a 2009 McDonald's All-American as a senior after he averaged 15.3 points, 10.1 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 2.5 blocks per game for the year, a Jordan Brand All-American, and a third-team Parade All-American and Slam All-American.He was named 2009 North Carolina Mr. Basketball by the Charlotte Observer, and was twice an All-State pick.In addition, he competed in the high jump in track and field, with an individual best jump of 6 feet 8 inches.His brother Miles had originally committed to play at Stanford, but chose to follow him to Duke after Stanford coach Trent Johnson left for LSU. Mason was elated, as they had been in boarding school together, and never really spent much time apart.He missed the first six games of the 2009–10 season with a broken left wrist.He and Miles usually rotated into games together, replacing Brian Zoubek and Lance Thomas, and were often the first two players off the bench.Teammate Nolan Smith said: ""He's an athlete. He can run and jump with the best of them in the country.""Through April 4, 2010, Mason was tied for first on the team in blocks, with 30, and second on the team with 21 dunks. In an average 14.1 minutes of play per game during the 2009–10 season, he averaged 3.1 rebounds and .9 blocks. Coach Mike Krzyzewski said: ""Mason has got a chance to be really, really good. He has skills of a guard and the body of a big man, and a great basketball mind. He's very competitive, he likes the stage, and he's comfortable with the ball."" It was anticipated that in 2010–11 the two brothers would both be in Duke's starting lineup. Georgia Tech coach Paul Hewitt viewed Mason as Duke's best pro prospect. Told in early April 2010 that some scouting services viewed him as the team's best pro prospect, Plumlee said: ""I have seen that. I don't even really know what to say to those people. I mean, let's be real. I'm trying to play the best I can, but in reality nobody goes from the bench to the NBA. Come on."" Mason started 11 of the team's first 13 games in the 2010–2011 season, in 3 of which he recorded double doubles in points and rebounds. For the season, he averaged 7.5 points, 8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game to help man the paint for the defending champion Blue Devils. He was a 2012–13 first team Academic All-American selection.

On April 8, 2014, the Nets faced the two-time defending champion Miami Heat, looking to become the first team to sweep LeBron James in a four-game season series. With Kevin Garnett resting his back and Andray Blatche out with illness, Plumlee was the only active center on the Nets roster. The Nets held an 88-87 lead in the closing seconds when James attempted a dunk that would have won the game for the Heat. Plumlee blocked the shot and secured the season sweep in what the New York Times described as a signature moment in his career. Although James was visibly upset about the play, and claimed that he had been fouled, the NBA later announced that the call was correct and that the block was clean. In 70 games (22 starts), he averaged 7.4 points and 4.4 rebounds per game as he earned NBA All-Rookie first team honors, becoming the first Net since Brook Lopez (2008–09) to earn such honors. Following the departure of Andray Blatche, Plumlee came into the season as the primary back-up to Brook Lopez. On October 24, 2014, the Nets exercised their third-year team option on Plumlee's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2015–16 season.

In Game 4 of the series, Plumlee recorded 14 rebounds, 10 assists, three blocks and two points in a 98–84 win, tying the series at 2–2.

He played college basketball for the Utah Utes. In his sophomore year, Pöltl was a consensus second-team All-American, and won the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award and Pete Newell Big Man Award as the top collegiate center and low-post player, respectively. After the season, he declared for the 2016 NBA draft, where the Toronto Raptors selected him in the first round with the ninth overall pick. Pöltl was born in Vienna, Austria. Both his parents were members of the Austrian national volleyball teams.His parents opted for basketball because there was a youth basketball program near their Vienna home during his childhood.He played one year for the Arkadia Traiskirchen Lions of the Austrian Bundesliga in 2013–14.Pöltl was relatively unknown in the United States until the 2013 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. University of Utah assistant Andy Hill went to the tournament, held in Macedonia, largely to scout potential prospects from other teams; he only saw Austria's opening game against the Netherlands because he vowed to watch all 38 teams in person. After seeing Pöltl's 15-rebound performance, Hill began sounding Pöltl out for potential interest in playing college basketball in the United States. Pöltl went on to average a double-double in points and rebounds during the tournament and was named to the second all-tournament team, despite Austria going 1–6 and finishing 20th out of 22 teams in the second-level Division B.Pöltl began drawing interest from several NCAA Division I programs, forcing him to decide between a professional career and a U.S. college education. In a 2014 interview, Pöltl revealed part of his decision-making process:In 2014, Pöltl committed to Utah to play college basketball, in large part due to the relationship he had developed with their coaching staff.Utah head coach Larry Krystkowiak was one of three Division I head coaches and two assistant coaches to travel to Vienna to recruit him in person, and made the trip of over 5,000 miles (8,000 km) twice. Pöltl was impressed that Krystkowiak made the effort to visit with him in person, and was intrigued that the 6-foot-10-inch (2.08 m) coach played power forward in the NBA and had a history of developing young big men.Pöltl became a starter in his first year, and in his first game he scored 18 points and had 10 rebounds.During his second season in 2015–16, he was named to the 35-man midseason watchlist for the Naismith Trophy on 11 February.On 7 March 2016, Pöltl was named the Pac-12 Player of the Year and All-Pac-12 First Team.

He is one of the tallest active players in the NBA, standing at 7 ft 3 in (2.21 m) tall, and plays both the power forward and center positions. Born in Liepāja, Porziņģis began his professional career with EuroLeague team Sevilla in 2011. Porziņģis quickly rose through the team's youth ranks and became the figurehead of the senior team by 2013. He subsequently won the EuroCup Basketball Rising Star award in 2015, where, at age 18, he became the youngest ever recipient of the award. The following summer, he declared for the NBA draft, where he was selected fourth overall by the New York Knicks. In New York, Porziņģis shone as the team's star, but, after disagreements with the front office, was traded to Dallas in 2019. Porziņģis followed his parents' footsteps and started to play basketball at age 6. Once he turned 12, his older brother, Jānis, who played professionally in Europe, would take him to offseason training sessions.He played in youth competition with BK Liepājas Lauvas, the most famous club based in hometown of Liepāja, until he was 15 years old. An agent from Latvia sent video of him around this time to teams in Spain and Italy.In 2010, Baloncesto Sevilla, a club that had a professional team competing in the Liga ACB in Spain, called Porziņģis for a tryout in an attempt to recruit foreign talent to its junior squads. He stood 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) and weighed 157 lb (71 kg) at this time.Porziņģis recalled the moment and said, ""I came here with my brother for two or three days, but it was really hot and I couldn't play at my best because of that. Still, I received a contract in summer 2010 and I signed it.""Inmaculada Avivar, a nutritionist for Sevilla, diagnosed that Porziņģis was suffering from anemia, meaning that he had fewer red blood cells.This caused him to feel fatigue, shortness of breath, and inability to exercise. Nevertheless, he gradually overcame the condition and began seeing improvement in his game.In addition to his medical problems, Porziņģis had trouble picking up the language in Seville, making him reluctant to return there after his first tryout. In his first season playing for the junior squad, he struggled to communicate with the coaching staff and his teammates and was often sleepy due to his health.Porziņģis debuted for the youth squad on 4 January 2012, against its counterpart from Barcelona, adding 12 points and 10 rebounds. The opposing side was led by Alexander Zhigulin, who would go on to enter the 2015 NBA draft and withdraw.However, Sevilla was defeated, 56–75.This game was part of the Ciutat de L'Hospitalet tournament, which led up to the Nike International Junior Tournament (NIJT).On 5 January, he scored a personal best of 16 points on the Spars Sarajevo youth squad, helping Sevilla beat their opponents by a margin of 8 points.Porziņģis said, ""I knew it was a prestigious tournament and that I had to do well"", he said. ""I think I could have done much better, but I wasn't physically 100 percent. I have seen videos and could have been much more aggressive. But I wish I could have played better.""He finished the tournament averaging 9.2 points, 4.8 rebounds and 2.6 blocks.Porziņģis represented the Sevilla junior team again at the same tournament in early 2013. Against Union Olimpija on 4 January, he recorded 15 points and 6 rebounds.On 6 January, in the team's tournament finale vs Real Madrid's youth squad, he scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. He also made a total of five three-pointers. Porziņģis proved to be more effective in his second year, averaging 16.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.6 blocks and going .481 on three-pointers.This would be his final stint in the youth categories of Sevilla. Entering the 2012–13 ACB season, Sevilla had hired Aíto García Reneses, who previously worked with the likes of Pau Gasol, Juan Carlos Navarro, Ricky Rubio and Rudy Fernández.On 29 September 2012, Porziņģis got the opportunity to make an appearance with the club's first team, but was allowed to play just a minute. Sevilla took a tremendous loss to CB Murcia. Following a return to the youth categories of the club at the Torneig de Bàsquet Junior Ciutat de L'Hospitalet, he went back to competing for the senior squad. On 16 January 2013, he logged only four minutes against Spartak Saint Petersburg in the EuroCup, scoring no points, but contributing one rebound and one assist. He scored his first basket for the senior team on 20 February 2013, in a rematch with Spartak. Porziņģis said, ""I was very nervous at the beginning: I wanted to do well and not pick up turnovers. At the same time, I got a lot of confidence with players of my same age. That allowed me to play better with the first team and practice with more confidence.""On 4 May 2013, he posted a season-high 7 points with the senior team, hitting two of three shots vs Bilbao Basket in ACB competition. Porziņģis opened his second season on Sevilla's main squad strong in his third game against the EuroLeague team Laboral Kutxa, leading them to a 20-point ACB victory on 2 November 2013.He notched a career-high 12 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 blocks. He broke his scoring record once more against Real Madrid on 30 November 2013, nearly leading his team to a victory. Against the very same team on 6 April 2014, Porziņģis scored a career-high 20 points, nailing 2 three-pointers. Despite his team losing, he began to trend on social media because of his performance. He said, ""It was a very good game for me on offense. I didn't get any rebounds in that game. I had a good shooting night, but could have helped more on defense. Still, fans in Madrid gave me a nice ovation when I fouled out and I liked that a lot.""On 25 May, he got the chance to face his idol Justin Doellman of Barcelona, whom he called the ""best power forward in Spanish basketball"". He scored 14 points against Doellman's team. In May 2014, Porziņģis was selected in the ACB All-Young Players Team of the 2013–14 season. In April, Porziņģis declared himself eligible for the 2014 NBA draft. Before and after he made the decision, he drew interest from National Basketball Association (NBA) teams such as the Orlando Magic, who held the 12th overall pick, and traveled to Europe to scout him. The Oklahoma City Thunder reportedly were certainly going to select him with the 21st pick in the case that he remained. Porziņģis was considered an unfinished product and a top-15 draft pick. According to DraftExpress.com, he was the fourth-youngest prospect in their top-100 rankings. Shortly before the day of the draft, however, he withdrew his name. Porziņģis's agent Andy Miller released the information to ESPN, saying that his client did not feel prepared to become a part of the NBA and wanted to develop his skills until the 2015 draft. One of the league's general managers commented on him, ""He's very talented. He wasn't ready, but we would've seriously considered drafting him anyway. If he continues to develop his game, get more minutes and his body develops, I think he could be a top-five pick in 2015. He has that kind of talent."" Prior to the 2014–15 ACB season, head coach Aíto García Reneses parted ways with Sevilla. On 4 October 2014, against CB 1939 Canarias, Porziņģis made his season debut in the Liga ACB, scoring 3 points in the game. He made his first appearance at the 2014–15 EuroCup on 15 October, vs. EWE Baskets Oldenburg and scored 2 points. However, he had a strong EuroCup performance against Pallacanestro Virtus Roma in the weeks that followed, in which he contributed 18 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks. He recorded a double-double in mid-November in a win over Estudiantes, adding 11 points and 11 rebounds. On 11 February 2015, he scored a season-high 19 points against the EuroCup's Turów Zgorzelec. He tied this record on 18 April 2015, vs. Bàsquet Manresa in the ACB. On 15 April 2015, Porziņģis was named the winner of the EuroCup Rising Star Award of the season. One month later, he repeated in the ACB All-Young Players Team, after avoiding the relegation with Baloncesto Sevilla. On 16 April 2015, Porziņģis entered the 2015 NBA draft, according to a report from agent Andy Miller. After gaining a season more of experience, he became known as a lottery pick and a potential top-5 selection. He drew interest from teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers, who had the No. 2 pick and had several personnel that had seen Porziņģis play in Spain. He was compared with players such as Pau Gasol and Dirk Nowitzki, but also Darko Miličić, a former lottery selection widely considered a draft bust. Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports wrote, ""Porziņģis has an innate awareness about the way the American public sees a young, long European teenager. He comes to the NBA with the full understanding that popular basketball culture declares him guilty until proven innocent of the basketball crimes of Darko Miličić and Nikoloz Tskitishvili and Andrea Bargnani. He's considered a stiff, a bust, a blown lottery pick until he doesn't become one..."" On 25 June 2015, Porziņģis was selected with the fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. He was booed by some New York fans upon being drafted, but vowed to change the fans' opinions on him from negative to positive. On the same night, the New York Knicks traded for Porziņģis' teammate from Sevilla, Willy Hernangómez, who was originally drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers as a 35th overall pick. Porziņģis became the highest drafted Latvian and Baltic player in NBA history. On 30 July 2015, Porziņģis signed his rookie-scale contract with the Knicks. On 28 October 2015, he scored 16 points in his NBA debut, leading New York to a 122–97 season-opening win over the Milwaukee Bucks. He was 3 of 11 from the field and 9 of 12 from the line. On 21 November 2015, he had 24 points, 14 rebounds and seven blocked shots to lead the Knicks to a 107–102 victory over the Houston Rockets, becoming the first 20-year-old to post such a stat line in a single game since Shaquille O'Neal in 1992–93. He became the first rookie to reach those totals since Tim Duncan in 1998. On 3 December 2015, he was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for games played in October and November. He ranked third among all rookies in scoring (13.7 ppg) and was second in rebounding (9.3 rpg) and blocked shots (1.89 bpg) for October and November. He went on to claim Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honours for December and January as well. On 12 February 2016, he scored 30 points for Team World in the Rising Stars Challenge. On 23 March 2016, he tied a career high with 29 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a 115–107 win over the Chicago Bulls. He was one point short of becoming the first rookie since Patrick Ewing to put up 30 points and 10 rebounds in one game for the Knicks. Porziņģis appeared in 72 of the Knicks' 82 games in 2015–16, missing the final seven games of the season due to a right shoulder strain. He finished with averages of 14.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.9 blocks per game. Porziņģis finished second in the NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting behind winner Karl-Anthony Towns, and earned NBA All-Rookie First Team honors. On 16 November 2016, Porziņģis scored a career-high 35 points in a 105–102 win over the Detroit Pistons. On 11 December 2016, he recorded 26 points, 12 rebounds and a career high-tying seven blocks in a 118–112 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. On 19 January 2017, he came off the bench for the first time in his NBA career after returning from a four-game absence due to a sore left Achilles tendon. He subsequently scored 15 points in a 113–110 loss to the Washington Wizards. During the 2017 All-Star Weekend, Porziņģis played for Team World in the Rising Stars Challenge and won the Skills Challenge. In the Knicks' season opener the following season, on 19 October 2017, Porziņģis had 31 points and 12 rebounds in a 105–84 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On 30 October 2017, he scored a career-high 38 points in a 116–110 win over the Denver Nuggets. Less than a week later, on 5 November, Porziņģis set a new career high with 40 points in a 108–101 win over the Indiana Pacers. Porziņģis was subsequently named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played from Monday, 30 October through Sunday, 5 November. Porziņģis would record the best start to a season for Knicks player, earning 300 points through 10 games, two more than Bernard King had to open the 1984–85 season, and his performances continued, where, on 23 January 2018, he was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve. However, on 6 February 2018, in a 103–89 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, Porziņģis tore his left ACL. He was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season. In October 2018, the Knicks decided against signing Porziņģis to a rookie extension, a move that will give New York an extra $10 million in cap space in the summer of 2019 while making Porziņģis a restricted free agent in the offseason. Due to recovering from his ACL injury, Porziņģis did not play for the Knicks to begin the 2018–19 season. On 31 January 2019, after a meeting with the Knicks left franchise officials with the impression that he wanted to be traded, Porziņģis was traded alongside Trey Burke, Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, Dennis Smith Jr., an unprotected 2021 first-round draft pick, and an additional top-ten protected 2023 first round draft pick. He sat out the remainder of the 2018–19 season, healing from his ACL injury. On 12 July, Porziņģis agreed to re-sign with the Mavericks on a five-year maximum contract worth $158 million. Porziņģis played with the Latvian youth team and was selected in the 2013 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship All-Tournament Team. In 2015, Porziņģis was named the Latvian Rising Star of the Year. In 2017, Porziņģis played for Latvia at EuroBasket 2017, where he averaged 23.6 points per game (ranked 3rd), 5.9 rebounds per game (ranked 19th) and 1.9 blocks per game (ranked 1st). Latvia was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Slovenia, losing 103–97. Porziņģis has been compared to Dirk Nowitzki, with the pair having both been groomed in Europe before entering the NBA. Both Porziņģis and Nowitzki are seven-foot-plus players who are comfortable anywhere on the front line and can both shoot from the outside. During his rookie season, Kevin Durant dubbed Porziņģis a basketball ""unicorn"" because of his rare combination of talents. In January 2018, Porziņģis was averaging 19 shot attempts per game for the Knicks, the most ever by a player his size (the only players 7 ft 3 in (2.21 m) or taller to average 15 field goal attempts per game were Ralph Sampson and Yao Ming). Due to his height and mobility, Porziņģis is able to shoot over any defender, with his sheer size and high volume creating a unique advantage shared by no other player in the league. Porziņģis was born to parents who had experience playing the game of basketball. Tālis, his father, competed semi-professionally before becoming a bus driver. His mother, Ingrīda, was previously on Latvia women's youth national basketball team. Kristaps's older brother, Jānis, also played professionally,while Mārtiņš, who is approximately fifteen years older than his youngest sibling, was also an avid player. In a 2017 E:60 documentary on Porziņģis' life, his parents revealed that they had another son, Toms, who was born four years before Kristaps and died at 14 months. Through an interpreter, Ingrīda said about Toms' death, ""It felt like a bulldozer had run over my life. We had two other children who we had to care for. We had to live on. After Kristaps was born, it was like he had to live for two lives."" Jānis Porziņģis competed at the European 2nd tier EuroCup level, the same level in Europe that Kristaps later played at, in one game, and played European professional club basketball in various national leagues, including the Italian League, for more than 10 years. He is known to mentor his younger brother on and off the court and often called him after playing games for Cajasol Sevilla in Spain. Kristaps talked about the relationship in an interview, ""We'd break down the details. We watched the film together. He's always pushing me to work hard. We just spend a lot of time together and we just talk about basketball all the time..."" The elder Porziņģis helped him train in the summer and work out in the gym in preparation for international competition in 2012.Following two seasons in Spain and almost two years living in Seville, Porziņģis was able to speak Spanish far more fluently. Porziņģis is thus fluent in three different languages, including English.An NBA executive said, ""He speaks great English and I don't see it being that difficult of a transition off the court."" In October 2016, Porziņģis signed a shoe deal with Adidas, the most lucrative deal for a European player. He made the switch to Adidas after partnering with Nike for his rookie season. Porziņģis is a football fan and supports his hometown team FK Liepāja, as well as Real Madrid and former club Sevilla. He is also an avid fan of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which he plays regularly. In March 2019, it was publicly revealed that a woman accused Porziņģis of raping her at the Sky building in February 2018, hours after he tore his ACL. The woman reportedly told police she waited more than a year to come forward because she had discussed getting a $68,000 payout from Porziņģis to keep quiet. Porziņģis' attorney, Roland G. Riopelle, publicly denied the claim, and said he had previously referred the case to federal authorities due to the ""accuser's extortionate demands"".",26537,3426,2019-20,42.0,42.0,1283.0,7.5,17.9,0.416,2.7,7.8,0.35,4.7,10.2,0.467,4.1,5.2,0.775,1.9,8.8,10.7,1.7,0.8,2.2,2.0,3.7,21.7,7.0,Dallas Mavericks

Powell (born May 25, 1993)is an American professional basketball player for the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Playing college basketball with the UCLA Bruins, he was an all-conference player in the Pac-12. He was selected in the second round of the 2015 NBA draft. Powell was a two-time all-state high school player in California and led his team to a state championship before joining UCLA. After entering his senior year in 2014–15 as the Bruins' top returning player, he emerged as a team leader and received first-team All-Pac-12 honors. He was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks, who subsequently traded his draft rights to Toronto. Powell was born in San Diego, California, to Sharon and Norman Powell Sr.He was introduced to basketball by his uncle, Raymond Edwards. Powell decided to attend high school at Lincoln High, which had just been rebuilt and lost many athletes.He helped rebuild their basketball program,leading the team to consecutive California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) San Diego Section 2A championships in 2009 and 2010. The team also captured the 2010 CIF Division II Boys' State Championship, with Powell scoring 24 points in a 74–59 win over Mountain View St. Francis. He finished his junior season averaging 19.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 2.7 steals, and earned first-team all-state as well as Western League Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors.In his senior year, he was again first-team all-state and league MVP, and averaged 20.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.4 steals. Lincoln was 32–2 and won the league title with a 12–0 record. They were ranked No. 3 in California and No. 15 nationally, but were defeated 74–69 by Summit in the state semifinals.He finished his high school career winning the San Diego County All Star Game Dunk Contest.Considered a four-star recruit by ESPN.com, Powell was listed as the No. 15 shooting guard and the No. 52 player in the nation in 2011.Powell chose to play college basketball for UCLA over San Diego State, Arizona and Oregon.In his first year at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), he was the only true freshman to play significant minutes in 2011–12, when he averaged 17.8 minutes and contributed 4.6 points and 2.2 rebounds in 33 games, joining Tyler Lamb and Lazeric Jones as the only Bruins to play in every game that season.While he excelled as a driving guard in high school, his role transformed at UCLA, taking less than one-fourth of his shots around the rim and close to half from outside on three-point attempts,connecting on 38.5% over the last 18 games.Powell averaged 6.1 points in 22.1 minutes in 2012–13, making nine starts while playing all 35 games.He began the season as a starter, but was later moved to the bench. His minutes declined from an average of 28.4 in the first seven games to 19 the following 26 games. After replacing injured starter Jordan Adams, Powell's minutes increased to 37 per game.He considered transferring to San Diego State after the season, but decided to stay primarily because UCLA coach Ben Howland was fired.Powell credited Howland for his development on defense, but he stated that ""there were a lot of things going on that weren’t fair for me"" and ""I definitely wanted to see a change."" The Bruins hired Steve Alford as their new coach.In 2013–14, Powell started all 37 games and was third on the team in scoring (11.4).Under Alford, he became an offensive threat and a staunch defender.He was more aggressive taking the ball to the basket, and dunked more than he could in Howland's system. The team's best on-ball defender, Powell was routinely assigned the opponent's best offensive player and earned honorable mention for the Pac-12 Conference All-Defensive Team. UCLA opened the 2014 NCAA Tournament in San Diego, enabling him to play in his hometown for the first time since high school. UCLA advanced to the Sweet 16, and Powell averaged 13.0 points and 2.7 rebounds in three tournament contests. After the season, he considered playing professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and requested an evaluation of his prospects for the upcoming 2014 NBA draft. Informed that he was unlikely to be drafted, Powell decided to return for his senior year, and became UCLA's top returning player and scorer for 2014–15 after underclassmen Adams, Kyle Anderson and Zach LaVine each declared for the NBA draft, while seniors Travis and David Wear graduated. During the offseason, Powell worked to improve his jump shot. As the season progressed, he grew to be a leader of the team, and increasingly took on more of the offensive load. Although freshman teammate Kevon Looney was seen as a potential NBA lottery pick, Powell became the Bruins' most consistent performer.On March 1, 2015, Powell scored a career-high 28 points in a 72–67 win over Washington State. He averaged 26 points and 5.5 rebounds in two games that week, and was honored with his conference-high third Pac-12 Player of the Week for the season. The Bruins went 2–0, helping them secure an eventual No.4 seed and first-round bye in the 2015 Pac-12 Tournament, and maintaining their hopes of receiving a bid to the NCAA Tournament. At season's end, Powell was voted first-team All-Pac-12, and again received honorable mention for the All-Defensive Team. He was also named first-team all-district by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA),and second-team all-district by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC). He finished as the team leader in scoring with 16.4 points per game, the sixth highest in the conference.On June 25, 2015, Powell was selected with the 46th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks. His draft rights, along with a 2017 first-round draft pick, were subsequently traded to the Toronto Raptors for Greivis Vásquez. After signing with Toronto on July 15, he played with the Raptors in the 2015 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, where he was the only rookie to be named to the All-NBA Summer League First Team. Powell received playing time early in 2015–16 due to injuries to Terrence Ross and DeMarre Carroll. He later received multiple assignments to Raptors 905, Toronto's D-League affiliate. With Carroll out after knee surgery and James Johnson sidelined with a sprained ankle, Powell made his first NBA start on February 2, 2016, going scoreless with two steals in 15 minutes in a 104–97 win over the Phoenix Suns. On March 15, he made his eighth career start and scored a then season-high 17 points in a 107–89 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. He topped that mark on March 28, scoring 18 points in a 119–100 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Two days later, he scored 10 points in a 105–97 win over the Atlanta Hawks, helping the Raptors record a 50-win season for the first time in franchise history. On April 8, with All-Stars DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry resting, Powell set a new season high with 27 points in a 111–98 win over the Indiana Pacers. In the Raptors' regular-season finale, Powell topped that mark again with 30 points in a 103–96 win over the Brooklyn Nets. After averaging an Eastern Conference-leading 15.3 points per game in April, he was named the conference's NBA Rookie of the Month. Powell played sparingly for the Raptors over the first half of the 2016–17 season. With DeMarre Carroll sitting out back-to-back games early on in the season, Powell received a number of starting assignments. He would rise to the occasion every time he got an opportunity, only to go missing in action for a handful of games before his services were needed again. On December 20, 2016, Powell scored a season-high 21 off the bench in a 116–104 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He had three more 21-point games over the next three months. On April 24, 2017, in Game 5 of the Raptors' first-round playoff series against the Milwaukee Bucks, Powell scored a playoff career-high 25 points to help the Raptors take a 3–2 series lead with a 118–93 win. On October 8, 2017, Powell signed a four-year, $42 million contract extension with the Raptors. The deal, which started with the 2018–19 season, included a player option on the fourth year. On November 5, 2018, against the Utah Jazz, Powell partially dislocated his left shoulder joint, and was ruled out indefinitely. He returned to action on December 19 against the Indiana Pacers after missing 21 games. On January 6, 2019, he scored a season-high 23 points in a 121–105 win over the Pacers. On March 22, he had a career-high 11 rebounds in a 116–109 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On April 7, he matched his season high with 23 points in a 117–109 overtime win over the Miami Heat. Powell won his first championship when the Raptors defeated the Golden State Warriors in the 2019 NBA Finals in six games. In 2019–20, Fred VanVleet became the starting shooting guard after Toronto lost Danny Green in free agency. Powell began the season scoring in double digits only once once in the first seven games. On November 29, 2019, he scored 19 of his career-high 33 points in the third quarter in a 90–83 win over the Orlando Magic. As a starter in December in place of an injured VanVleet, he scored 20 or more points in three straight contests for the first time in his career. Later in the month, Powell injured his shoulder against the Detroit Pistons, and was out for three weeks before returning in mid-January. On January 31, 2020, he fractured the fourth metacarpal of his left hand against the Pistons and was ruled out indefinitely. Powell has two older sisters, Joniece and Margaret.

He was selected 11th overall by the Orlando Magic in the 2006 NBA draft. He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils. In college, Redick was known for his good three-point and free throw shooting.He set ACC records during his career for most points and most career ACC tournament points, though his ACC career points record was subsequently broken at UNC in 2009. Redick is currently the all-time leading scorer for Duke.He also set several other Duke records, including most points in a single season. Redick's jersey was retired by Duke on February 4, 2007.After being drafted by the Magic, he played for seven seasons in Orlando, followed by a short spell with the Milwaukee Bucks, then four seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. In 2017, he signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia 76ers, and re-signed with them on a one-year deal the following year. In 2019, Redick signed a two-year deal with the New Orleans Pelicans. In addition to his basketball career, Redick is a podcaster, and hosts a basketball and entertainment podcast for The Ringer.Redick was a McDonald's All-American at Cave Spring High School in Roanoke, Virginia,winning the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game MVP. He scored 43 points as a senior in the Virginia state championship game, a game in which the Knights defeated George Wythe High School of Richmond. Considered a five-star recruit by Scout.com, Redick was highly recruited and listed as the No. 2 shooting guard and the No. 13 player in the nation in 2002.In his freshman year at Duke University, he led his team with 30 points in their victory over North Carolina State in the ACC Tournament championship game. He put up 26 points against Central Michigan in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.However, he struggled in Duke's Sweet Sixteen loss to the Kansas Jayhawks, hitting only two of 16 shots.Redick served as co-captain in his junior year, along with senior point guard Daniel Ewing.He also served as captain his senior year, along with fellow seniors Shelden Williams, Sean Dockery and Lee Melchionni. In the 2004–05 season, Redick led Duke in scoring with 21.8 points per game. He won the ACC Player of the Year award, and the Adolph F. Rupp Trophy for national player of the year.Redick's victory in the Rupp voting spoiled the consensus for Utah's Andrew Bogut, who won every other major player of the year award. In 2006, after facing close competition all year from Gonzaga player Adam Morrison, Redick won the major player of the year awards. Redick set a record for the most consecutive free throws made in the ACC with 54.This record began on March 20, 2003 and ended on January 15, 2004. It was broken on January 22, 2012 by Scott Wood from NC State. Redick entered his final post-season with a chance to go down as the NCAA's all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3%, was held at the time by Gary Buchanan of Villanova. In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, Redick struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724). On February 14, 2006, in the first half of a game against Wake Forest, Redick broke Virginia alumnus Curtis Staples's NCAA record of 413 career three-pointers made. Keydren Clark of Saint Peter's College subsequently surpassed Redick's mark in the MAAC Tournament. However, Redick returned the favor by hitting 15 three-pointers in the ACC Tournament and 12 in the NCAA Tournament to finish ahead of Clark. Redick finished his career with an NCAA-record 457 three-point field goals shooting 40.4% from three-point range.His career three-pointers record was broken on February 2, 2014, by Oakland University's Travis Bader. In the game after breaking Staples' record, Redick scored 30 points on February 19, 2006, against Miami to become the all-time leading scorer at Duke, with 2,557 points scored in his career. On February 25, 2006, in a game at Temple University, Redick passed Dickie Hemric's 51-year-old ACC scoring record of 2,587 points with a pair of free throws in the waning minutes of the game. His record was topped in one of the opening round games of the 2009 NCAA tournament by North Carolina Tar Heel Tyler Hansbrough. Redick finished his career with 2,769 points. On March 10, 2006, in an ACC Tournament quarterfinal against Miami, Redick scored 25 points, setting a Duke record for points in a season with 858. Redick ended the season with 964 points. Redick came up just short of the ACC record for points scored in a season, which was set by Dennis Scott with 970 points in 1990. Redick also finished his career as the leading scorer in ACC tournament history.His total of 225 points eclipsed Wake Forest's Len Chappell, who scored 220 points in the tournament from 1960 to 1962. As the marquee player of the Blue Devils, Redick was the target of abuse by fans. Clay Travis, of CBS Sports, called him the ""most hated current athlete in America."" After students from rivals Maryland and North Carolina discovered his cell phone number, Redick estimated that he received 50 to 75 hate calls per day from opposing fans. He was often the target of obscenity-laced tirades from fans. He had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season, tied as of March 28, 2010, for 5th-most in Duke history with Jon Scheyer, Shane Battier, and Jason Williams. On February 4, 2007, Redick's #4 jersey was retired at Cameron Indoor Stadium at a special halftime ceremony. Redick became the thirteenth Duke player to have his jersey retired. Redick was selected with the 11th pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. Pre-draft scouting reports praised Redick's perimeter shooting and basketball intelligence, but questioned his defensive ability and speculated that he might not be tall or athletic enough to create his own shots in the NBA. This scouting report was highlighted when Duke played LSU in the 2006 NCAA tournament. LSU's Garrett Temple, a 6'5"" guard known for his athleticism and a large wingspan, chased Redick throughout the game. Taken out of his normal rhythm, Redick—the number two scorer in the nation at the time—had one of the worst shooting performances of his college career, shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a Duke loss. In a 2005 interview with the Charlotte Observer, Redick said, ""I think I'll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. I don't expect to be a star, I'll just shoot, be a team player."" He moved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and Duke alum Grant Hill. Redick competed against Trevor Ariza and Keith Bogans for the starting shooting guard spot in 2007–08. He was pulled from playing more than once for his lack of defense during the preseason. He came into the season as a third-string player and saw limited action due to back spasms, but moved into limited rotation after Ariza was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers early in the season. In January 2008, Redick posted on his personal blog that ""it's been proven that even if I play well in the limited minutes I get that not much is going to change."" On January 31, 2008, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Redick had asked his agent, Arn Tellem, to inquire about a possible trade. ""We want to see what's out there,"" Redick said. ""I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating."" Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: ""Right now it would be very hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things."" The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the February 21, 2008 trade deadline. In the 2008–09 season, Redick averaged 17.4 minutes per game instead of the previous season's 8.1; he played in 64 games instead of the previous season's 34. He averaged six points per game. The Magic made it to the NBA Finals, but lost to the Lakers in five games. Redick started all seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in place of regular starter Courtney Lee. March 28, 2010 was a night of career-highs for Redick, in rebounds (7), assists (8) and minutes played (46). Vince Carter was injured just 95 seconds into the game; backup swingman Mickael Pietrus was also injured, leaving Redick to play the entire game. On July 9, 2010, the Chicago Bulls signed Redick to a three-year, $19 million offer sheet. The Magic matched this offer on July 16, 2010, retaining the rights to Redick. On April 25, 2012, Redick achieved a career high with the Magic, scoring 31 points against the Charlotte Bobcats. On February 21, 2013, Redick was traded from the Magic to the Milwaukee Bucks along with guard Ish Smith and forward Gustavo Ayon for guard Beno Udrih, guard Doron Lamb, and forward Tobias Harris. Redick had difficulties in Milwaukee and his performance suffered. On July 10, 2013, Redick was acquired by the Los Angeles Clippers via a three-team sign-and-trade deal that also involved the Bucks and the Phoenix Suns. Redick reportedly signed a four-year, $27 million contract. Redick started 218 of the first 219 games he played for the Clippers, becoming a ""full-fledged starter"" in the NBA. On January 15, 2014, Redick scored a then career-high 33 points in a 129–127 win over the Dallas Mavericks. On January 18, 2016, Redick scored a career-high 40 points in a 140–132 overtime win over the Houston Rockets. He connected on his first five attempts behind the arc and finished 9-of-12 on three-pointers, tying Caron Butler's franchise record for three-pointers made in a game. He later competed in the Three-Point Contest during the 2016 NBA All-Star weekend. On November 5, 2016, Redick increased his streak of consecutive games with a made three-pointer to 62, in a 116–92 win over the San Antonio Spurs. He also completed a four-point play against the Spurs, the 26th of his career. On April 12, 2017, Redick made three 3-pointers against Sacramento in the regular-season finale to finish with 201, breaking his career high and single-season franchise record of 200. The Clippers went on to lose in the first round of the NBA playoffs in seven games to the Utah Jazz. On July 8, 2017, Redick signed a one-year, $23 million contract with the Philadelphia 76ers.

On December 19, in a 131–109 win over the New York Knicks, Redick scored his 10,000th career point. On February 8, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 117–110 win over the Denver Nuggets. On March 19, he was two assists shy of his first NBA triple-double in 761 career games, finishing with 27 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in a 118–114 win over the Charlotte Hornets.

Robinson and Michigan State Spartans men's basketball player Gary Harris represented the Michigan–Michigan State basketball rivalry on one of the four regional versions. On December 14, Robinson tallied 20 points on 8–9 field goal shooting and 4 rebounds against (#1/#1) Arizona in a 72–70 loss. On December 28, against Holy Cross Robinson posted a career high with 23 points. In the January 2 Big Ten Conference opener against Minnesota, Robinson set a career high with 4 blocks despite missing the final 17:24 of the game with an injury to his left ankle. Robinson tied his career high with 23 points against Nebraska on February 5 as the team posted its largest conference game margin of victory since defeating Indiana 112-64 on February 22, 1998. On February 26, Robinson contributed a team-high 17 points including a game-winning overtime buzzer beater against his father's alma mater Purdue to help the team overcome its largest deficit of the season (19). On March 8, Robinson had his fourth 20-point game of the season to help Michigan close out its season with a season-ending 84–80 victory over Indiana. His 20 points included a tie-breaking 3-pointer with 1:10 remaining. Michigan clinched its first outright (unshared) Big Ten Conference championship since 1985–86. Following the regular season, he was named an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection by both the coaches and the media. Michigan played its first two games of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament at the BMO Harris Bradley Center, which was the home arena for Robinson's father, Glenn Robinson for most of his NBA career as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks. In the two games at the Bradley Center against Wofford and Texas, Robinson scored 14 points in each game and averaged 6 rebounds. In the Sweet Sixteen round, he opposed his father's former Purdue roommate and Tennessee head coach Cuonzo Martin. Robinson scored 13 points as Michigan again advanced in the tournament. The 2013–14 team was eliminated in the elite eight round of the NCAA Tournament by Kentucky. On April 15, in a joint press conference with Stauskas, Robinson announced that he was declaring himself eligible for the 2014 NBA draft. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. At the May NBA Draft Combine, Robinson excelled with the top standing vertical jump at the combine, the top small forward spot up shooting percentage and impressive measurements. Robinson pleased with his overall performance, but disappointed with his 41.5-inch (1.05 m) running vertical jump, which was short of his 44-inch (1.12 m) personal best. Robinson was drafted in the second round of the 2014 draft with the 40th overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. With teammates Stauskas and McGary also being drafted, it marked the first time Michigan had at least three draft picks since the 1990 NBA draft. With Burke and Hardaway having been drafted the year before, every player that started in the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game was drafted either in the 2013 or 2014 NBA draft. Robinson committed to represent the Timberwolves in 2014 NBA Summer League. On September 17, 2014, he signed with the Timberwolves and then made the opening day 15-man roster. Robinson made his professional debut with the Timberwolves on November 14 against the New Orleans Pelicans, scoring 1 point in 8 minutes of play. On November 21, he posted his first field goals with a 2-for-2 shooting performance against the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. Among his early performances, he tallied 7 points on December 6 against the Spurs and 4 rebounds on December 8 against the Golden State Warriors. On March 5, 2015, he was waived by the Timberwolves. On March 7, 2015, he was claimed off waivers by the Philadelphia 76ers. Robinson debuted for the 76ers on March 14 against the Brooklyn Nets, going scoreless in 7 minutes. He reached double digits for the first time on April 11 against the Chicago Bulls, scoring 10 points. Robinson started in the season finale on April 15 against the Miami Heat. It was his first and only start of the season and he posted a season-high 8 rebounds to go along with another 10-point performance. The 76ers opted not to make a qualifying offer to Robinson before the July 1, 2015 signing period, thus making him a free agent. He later joined the Atlanta Hawks for the 2015 NBA Summer League on July 9. On July 27, 2015, Robinson signed a three-year deal with the Indiana Pacers. Pacer General Manager Larry Bird noted that he had been attempting to acquire Robinson for some time due to the potential that he saw. He hooked Robinson up with shooting guru Hal Wissel for extra attention during his first offseason. Robinson entered the season impaired by shoulder soreness and did not dress for the October 28 season opener. Robinson began practicing with the team at the beginning of November as he recovered from his shoulder injury. On November 4, 2015, Robinson debuted with the Pacers against the Boston Celtics in their 5th game of the season. Robinson posted 10 points and 2 rebounds in over 19 minutes of action. On November 13, he posted 11 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves. On November 21, he scored a career-high 17 points off the bench and was 4-of-4 from three-point range against the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 27, he was assigned to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA Development League. He was recalled the next day. With George Hill attending to personal business and Rodney Stuckey injured, the Pacers—who only dressed 10 players— gave Robinson his first start of the season on January 17 against the Denver Nuggets. Hill missed three consecutive games and come off the bench for a fourth as he endured the loss of his grandmother, mourned the loss of a former IUPUI Jaguars men's basketball teammate and celebrated the birth of his first child. Hill replaced Robinson in the starting lineup on January 26 against the Los Angeles Clippers. On November 20, 2016, with forwards Paul George, C. J. Miles and Kevin Seraphin sidelined, Robinson started and posted a double double with 16 points and 11 rebounds in an overtime win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He got his second start of the season on November 25 and finished with a team high and career-high 20 points and five rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets. Those two starts were regarded as the best two performances of his career up to that date. Robinson returned to the starting lineup when Monta Ellis was injured in mid-December. He posted a season-high rebounding performance in a 12-point, 12-rebound double double against the Detroit Pistons in his fourth start in his return to the starting lineup. During the 2017 All-Star Weekend, Robinson became the first Pacers player since Fred Jones (in 2004) to win the Slam Dunk Contest. On March 24 with less than 3 weeks left in the regular season, Robinson was sidelined for at least two weeks with a calf strain. After missing the final 11 games of the regular season, Robinson was sidelined for the first game of the 2017 NBA Playoffs on April 15 against Cleveland, but he returned to the lineup for game 2 on April 17. Robinson was injured during a September 29, 2017 intrasquad scrimmage. On October 13, 2017, he was ruled out for three to four months after undergoing surgery for a repair of medial and lateral ligaments in his left ankle. On February 1, 2018, he began a rehab assignment with Fort Wayne. He was recalled by the Pacers later that day. On February 23, 2018, he made his season debut for the Pacers against the Atlanta Hawks. He had four points and two rebounds in 19 minutes. On July 7, 2018, Robinson signed with the Detroit Pistons. Robinson was injured on December 10 and was sidelined for the subsequent 8 games. Although he was cleared to play on December 30, he did not return to the court until late in the January 1, 2019 contest against the Milwaukee Bucks. On July 10, 2019, Robinson signed a two-year deal with the Golden State Warriors. On February 6, 2020, Robinson and teammate Alec Burks were traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for 3 second-round draft picks. Robinson is the son of Shantelle Clay and Glenn Robinson, who was Indiana Mr. Basketball,Collegiate national player of the year, NBA All-Star,NBA first overall draft pick, NBA champion, and an eleven-year NBA veteran.

He played college basketball with the Boston College Eagles.He was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the 2018 NBA draft with the 13th overall pick. Robinson was not ranked as a high school recruit and had trouble receiving offers from Power-5 programs coming out of Needham B. Broughton High School in Raleigh North Carolina. Boston College assistant coach Scott Spinelli, who is known for finding diamonds in the rough, was the only representative of a Power-5 school to offer Robinson. As a freshman, Robinson averaged 11.7 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assists per game for the 2015-16 season. As a sophomore, he averaged 18.7 points, 4 rebounds, 3.4 assists per game.

He was selected with the 36th overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft. Before beginning his professional career, he gained national coverage for withdrawing from his commitment to attend Western Kentucky University and instead dedicate the entire 2017–18 season for training on his own, being the first player to make such a decision. Mitchell Robinson attended Pine Forest High School in Pensacola, Florida for the first two years of his high school career, briefly transferring to Landry-Walker College and Career Preparatory High School in New Orleans as a sophomore, for whom he never played. He did appear for Pine Forest as a freshman and sophomore, but didn't make much of an impact, as he was still relatively new to basketball, only starting playing in eighth grade, during a growth spurt that took him from 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) to 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m).He first appeared in the summer league before his junior year for Chalmette High School.As a junior, Robinson led the Owls to their first state playoff win in 19 years, and in the second round, helped give the first seed and eventual state champion Natchitoches Central High School all they could handle before bowing out, their closest playoff game until the state final. He averaged 20.9 points, 13.6 rebounds, 8.1 blocks, and 2 steals per game. He made the all-district, all-Metro, and all-State teams for his efforts. Robinson then joined Dallas-based Nike Pro Skills on the AAU circuit for the summer, winning individual honors in the EYBL and leading Pro Skills to the season-ending Peach Jam. His recruiting ranking shot up, and he earned his fifth star. Against the top players in the country, Robinson averaged 15.5 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 4.1 blocks per game, being named to the All-EYBL second team.As a senior at Chalmette, Robinson averaged 25.7 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6 blocked shots per outing, while earning Naismith Trophy All-America honorable mention and MaxPreps All-America honorable mention status as well as USA Today All-USA Louisiana first team honors and being named All-District, All-Metro, All-State, and the All-Metro Player of the Year from the New Orleans Advocate, as well as the St. Bernard Post Male Athlete of the Year for the parish.He led Chalmette to their first district championship in their own regular season tournament in 20 years, first district title in 21 years in the toughest basketball district in the state, and to the state semifinals for the first time in 32 years.In the Owls' 4 game state playoff run, Robinson averaged 34.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 7.8 blocks. Robinson became the first Chalmette basketball player to be named a McDonald's All-American, and also played in the Jordan Brand Classic and the LHSBCA All-Star game. Playing in the 2017 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, Robinson tallied 14 points, three rebounds and two blocked shots.He participated in the 2017 Jordan Brand Classic, scoring 15 points in 17 minutes of play, while pulling down three rebounds. Robinson originally committed to play college basketball at Texas A&M, but then de-committed to follow coach Rick Stansbury to Western Kentucky. Stansbury had recruited Robinson as the Aggies' assistant coach. Basketball writer Jason Frakes wrote in February 2017, Robinson ""may go down as the biggest recruiting coup in WKU basketball history."" In July 2017, Robinson had enrolled at Western Kentucky University for the summer semester, and practiced with the team for about two weeks before a planned team trip to Costa Rica. Sources then indicated that he had left campus, and his room was cleaned out. He was then suspended indefinitely for violating the team rules. After speaking with head coach Rick Stansbury, he was granted a release to transfer, and barring an unexpected decision by the NCAA, would have had to sit out the 2017–18 season. With the hope that a waiver would be granted by the NCAA, Robinson took visits to Louisiana State University, University of Kansas, and the University of New Orleans in August 2017. On August 27, Robinson returned to Western Kentucky a month after leaving campus. On September 18, Robinson announced he would forgo college and prepare for the 2018 NBA draft on his own accord. He would be the first recruited draft pick to wind up not playing for any college, professional, or high school/postgraduate team throughout an entire year before entering an NBA draft, although he would still be credited as coming out of Western Kentucky by the NBA. Furthermore, because of his brief time going to summer classes in Western Kentucky, he was ultimately barred from participating in the NBA G League later in the season due to G League rules. The ruling also affected a few similar prospects who were stuck in difficult situations at the time as well, like Billy Preston and De'Anthony Melton. The announcement also influenced at least one person to train by themselves for a year before entering an NBA draft, as another five-star recruit named Darius Bazley originally planned on not going to college at Syracuse University in order to try out for the NBA G League before deciding against that as well, claiming that it was the only league where winning does not matter after all. Robinson was named one of 69 players who planned to participate in the NBA Draft Combine. However, on the day of the event, Robinson withdrew from all combine events. On June 21, 2018, Robinson was selected with the 36th overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. After appearing for the Knicks in the 2018 NBA Summer League, where he set summer league records for blocked shots and offensive rebounds, he signed a multi-year, rookie scale contract with the Knicks on July 8, 2018. After struggling with an ankle injury during the preseason, Robinson would make his professional debut on October 17, scoring two points in a 127–106 win against the Atlanta Hawks. Robinson made his first start on October 26, recording 7 points and 6 rebounds in 29 minutes of action in a 128–100 loss to the Golden State Warriors. On November 2, Robinson recorded his first double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds, alongside three assists and three steals, in a 118–106 win over the Dallas Mavericks. On November 11, Robinson set the Knicks' rookie record with nine blocks in a 115–89 loss to the Orlando Magic. On March 28, 2019, Robinson recorded season highs of 19 points and 21 rebounds in the Knicks' 117–92 loss to the Toronto Raptors, and became the first Knicks' rookie since Willis Reed in 1965 to record 19 points and 21 rebounds in a game. On April 9, he recorded eight points and 17 rebounds in a 96–86 win over the Chicago Bulls. Robinson finished the season second in the NBA in blocked shots per game, only behind Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, and was named to the All-Rookie Second Team. On December 17, 2019, Robinson scored a career-high 22 points and recorded 13 rebounds in a 143–120 win against the Hawks. On January 1, 2020, Robinson scored 22 points on perfect 11-of-11 shooting from the field in a 117–93 win against the Portland Trail Blazers. Robinson was named to the preliminary roster of the United States national under-19 team in 2017, but did not make the final cut for the 12-men squad for the 2017 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup. At the tryout, Robinson measured 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) without shoes, 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) with shoes, 223 pounds (101 kg), with a 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan and 9 ft 3 in (2.82 m) standing reach. Robinson has been called by some analysts ""the best shot blocker in his class"", with uncommon closing speed and a long reach that led to numerous highlight reel blocks. He uses that speed also to run the fast break exceptionally well for a big man of his size, being called the ""most entertaining player"" in the New Orleans area for his ability to convert alley-oop dunks. Robinson improved his free throw shooting over the course of his two years at Chalmette, and developed range from behind the three point line, making as many as 5 in a game.

Rondo played two years of college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats before he was drafted 21st overall by the Phoenix Suns in the 2006 NBA draft. He was subsequently traded to the Celtics, where he played a supporting role during his rookie season. Rondo, a four-time NBA All-Star, had led the league in assists per game three times (2012, 2013, and 2016). He was named to the All-NBA Third Team in 2011–12 and has earned four NBA All-Defensive Team honors, twice on the First Team (2009–10 and 2010–11). During his time in Boston, Rondo helped the Celtics advance to the NBA Finals in 2008 and 2010, winning a championship in 2008 as the team's starting point guard. Rondo has long been known as an elite facilitator in the NBA, ranking fourth in Celtics history in assists and third in steals. He is also considered a stat-sheet stuffer,ranking 11th in NBA history for triple-doubles with 32 in the regular season,to go with 10 in the playoffs.After 8½ seasons with the Celtics, Rondo was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in December 2014. A tumultuous five-month stint ensued, and in 2015, Rondo joined the Sacramento Kings. In 2016, he joined the Chicago Bulls, before joining the New Orleans Pelicans in 2017 and the Lakers in 2018. Rondo was born on February 22, 1986 in Louisville, Kentucky, to Amber Rondo.He has three siblings: Dymon, William and Anton.He had little contact with his father, who left his family when he was seven years old.To support the family, his mother worked the third shift at Philip Morris USA, a tobacco company.Rondo was first interested in football, before his mother steered him towards basketball because she felt that the sport would be less punishing on his skinny frame.After Rondo became serious about basketball, he attended Louisville's Eastern High School for three years. During his junior year at Eastern High School, he averaged 27.9 points, 10.0 rebounds and 7.5 assists which earned him a spot on the All-State honors and was named the 7th Region Player of the Year. He transferred to Virginia's Oak Hill Academy for his senior year where he averaged 21.0 points per game (ppg), 3.0 rebounds per game (rpg) and 12.0 assists per game (apg) and finished the 2003–04 season with a 38–0 record.In his senior year at Oak Hill Academy, Rondo broke Jeff McInnis's single-season school record of 303 assists, while averaging a double-double. There, he included two efforts of 27 assists and a single-game school record of 31, merely four away from the all-time national record.He also had a 55-point game in high-school, second highest all-time in Oak Hill Academy, surpassed only by Calvin Duncan with 61.Rondo was named to the McDonald's All-American Team in 2004 and scored a total of 14 points, 4 assists and 4 rebounds in the all-star game. He also participated in the 2004 Jordan Capital Classic game, logging 12 points, 5 assists and 4 steals. Rondo was also named a second-team Parade All-American. He ended his career as Oak Hill Academy's all-time assists leader in a single season with 494 assists, surpassing McInnis. Rondo committed to Kentucky over hometown Louisville. Rondo, along with All-Americans Joe Crawford and Randolph Morris, gave coach Tubby Smith and Kentucky the top-rated recruiting class for 2004 according to Rivals.com. Rondo led Kentucky to several wins including victories against the Louisville, South Carolina and Central Florida, but Kentucky failed to advance to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament in either Rondo's freshman or sophomore seasons. He was named to the SEC All-Freshmen Team. He set a Kentucky record for most steals in single-season, with a total of 87 steals in his freshman year and made at least one steal in every game. He finished his freshman year at Kentucky averaging 8.1 points, 2.9 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.6 steals. In his sophomore year he had a career-high 12 assists against Ole Miss, despite playing just 23 minutes, and 25 points against Louisville. Rondo also set another Kentucky Wildcats record for most rebounds in a game by a guard, with 19 rebounds in an early season loss to Iowa. He was not known for being a shooter, however, going 18–66 from three with a 57.1% FT average. He averaged 11.2 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.1 steals per game in his sophomore year. Rondo was also named to the 2005 USA Men's Under-21 World Championship Team, which traveled to Argentina for the FIBA World Championships. He averaged 11.0 ppg and 4.5 apg in the eight-game tournament, garnering much attention from NBA scouts. The USA U-21 team won a gold medal at the Global Games held in Texas in late July. Following the 2005–06 NCAA season, Rondo announced he would forgo his final two seasons at Kentucky and enter the NBA draft. Rondo was drafted 21st overall by the Phoenix Suns in the 2006 NBA draft. Phoenix then traded him to the Boston Celtics along with Brian Grant for the Cleveland Cavaliers' first-round draft pick in the 2007 NBA draft and cash considerations. He was the first point guard to be chosen in the draft. In another draft-day deal, the Celtics acquired Sebastian Telfair from the Portland Trail Blazers, finally uniting the backcourt Rick Pitino had envisioned at Louisville. He was signed by the Boston Celtics on July 4, 2006. During his rookie season in the NBA, Rondo played a supporting role and would split time with Sebastian Telfair and Delonte West. Rondo only started in 25 games that season due to his initial backup role to Telfair. He made his NBA regular season debut on November 1, 2006, in a home loss against the New Orleans Hornets. In his rookie season, he lacked on his jump shot which resulted in him slashing to the basket for a teardrop or layup. While coming off the bench, he managed to score a career-high 23 points against the Toronto Raptors,and record his first career double-double in a road losing effort against the Washington Wizards. In his first career start, he matched his career-high against the Los Angeles Clippers, though the line-ups were constantly being shuffled between Telfair and Rondo at the point guard.After officially becoming a starter, he began to receive more playing time (career-high 47 minutes of playing time)and show improvement (career-high 14 rebounds against the San Antonio Spurs, and a career-high 7 steals against the Indiana Pacers).As the mid-season approached, his numbers began to increase, which earned him an NBA All-Rookie Second Team selection. He finished the season with an average of 6.4 ppg and 3.8 apg, ranking in the top ten in the NBA in steals (128) and also ranking in the top ten among rookies in several other categories, including first in steals, second in assists and sixth in minutes. In the end, however, the Celtics finished the season with a 24–58 win-loss record and failed to qualify for the playoffs. After Telfair and West were traded during the offseason of the 2007–08 season, Rondo secured a spot in the starting lineup, starting in every game. Surrounded by All-Stars Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, he quickly became a steady, consistent player. In his 77 games played, he averaged 10.6 points per game (ppg), 5.1 assists per game (apg) and 4.2 rebounds per game (rpg). His role as a playmaker reflected in him leading the team in assists and steals. In a game against the New Jersey Nets, Rondo suffered a lower back injury late in the third quarter, forcing him to miss the next four games. He made his successful return from injury and to the starting lineup in a road win against the New York Knicks. A week later, he matched his career-high against the Miami Heat, and then scored a career-high 24 points in a home game against the Los Angeles Clippers the following month. During the All-Star break, he was selected to play on the Sophomore Team in the T-Mobile Rookie Challenge and Youth Jam. Following the All-Star weekend, Rondo recorded a career-high 16 assists in a home victory against the Charlotte Bobcats. Despite his solid rookie year, there was much speculation about Boston needing a veteran point guard. In March, they signed veteran point guard Sam Cassell as a free agent to serve as a backup. The Celtics' best single-season improvement in NBA history earned them the number one seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs. Following the regular season, Rondo finished in the top five for the NBA Most Improved Player voting. Rondo made his playoff debut on April 20, 2008 against the Atlanta Hawks and finished the game with 15 points, 9 assists and 2 steals. The Celtics closed out the series in seven games, went on to defeat Cleveland in the next round, and then beat the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In the NBA Finals, facing the Los Angeles Lakers, Rondo recorded two strong performances, including a career-high 16 assists in Game 2. In Game 3, however, Rondo left the court in the third quarter after rolling his ankle. The ankle injury was considered a ""non-factor,"" and Rondo eventually made his return in Game 4. In Game 6, the point guard posted a playoffs career-high 6 steals as the Celtics defeated the Lakers 4–2, giving Rondo his first NBA championship ring. After the game Lakers head coach Phil Jackson called Rondo the ""star"" of Game 6. In his third NBA campaign, the Celtics began the season with the best starting record in NBA history and also set a franchise record with a nineteen-game winning streak. Rondo's numbers increased from his previous season performance; however, he was criticized for his shooting. He recorded his first career triple-double along with a career-high in assists (16 points, 13 rebounds and 17 assists), against the Indiana Pacers. In a home win against the New York Knicks, Rondo led the team to tie a franchise record with 18 straight wins. However, after the winning streak was snapped the team struggled, losing seven out of nine games after ending the streak. Rondo—matched up with one of the league's quicker guards, Tony Parker—recorded 16 assists in a losing effort against the Spurs, one short of his season-high. Less than a week later against the Mavericks, he recorded his second career triple-double (19 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists), and then recorded a career-high 32 points against the Phoenix Suns on his 23rd birthday. He became the first NBA athlete to sign an endorsement contract with Red Bull on April 17, 2009. He finished the season ranking fifth in the NBA in assists (8.2) and steals (1.9). The team finished the season as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, although they entered the playoffs without their injured All-Star power forward Kevin Garnett. In the playoffs match-up against the Chicago Bulls, despite putting up a playoff career-high 29 points in Game 1, the Celtics lost in overtime. Boston won the next two games and in Games 2 and 4, Rondo recorded triple-doubles and became the first Celtic player with two triple-doubles in the same series since Larry Bird in 1986. He also became the first player with multiple triple-doubles in the same playoff series since Jason Kidd had three triple-doubles in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 6, he recorded a career-high 19 assists without a turnover, tying an NBA playoffs record. In the next round against the Orlando Magic, the Celtics lost the first game before Rondo's triple-double performance in Game 2 helped secure a home win. His third triple-double of the postseason tied Larry Bird's franchise record and also became the first to do that since Jason Kidd had four. However, the Celtics were defeated in seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. During the postseason, Rondo nearly averaged a triple double with 16.9 points, 9.7 rebounds and 9.8 assists. During the 2009–10 season, Rondo averaged career highs in points (13.7), assists (9.8) and steals (2.3) and became the first Celtic to lead the league in steals. On November 2, 2009, Rondo signed a five-year extension with the Celtics worth a guaranteed $55 million. In a road victory against the Orlando Magic on Christmas day, Rondo recorded 17 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists, two assists shy of a triple double. Three days later, Rondo scored 30 points along to go with 15 assists in a road loss to the Golden State Warriors. On January 10, 2010, Rondo recorded his third regular-season career triple-double, with 22 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds against the Toronto Raptors. On January 28, 2010, he received his first NBA All-Star selection as a reserve on the Eastern Conference squad for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. He also competed in the 2010 H-O-R-S-E contest but lost in the finals to Kevin Durant. Rondo recorded his fourth regular-season career triple-double against the Denver Nuggets on March 24, 2010, with 11 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds. Two days later against the Sacramento Kings, Rondo entered the game tied with Rick Fox for a franchise record of most steals in a single-season (167), eventually establishing the record with a second-quarter steal from Sean May. In a game against the Houston Rockets on April 2, 2010, he broke Bob Cousy's franchise record for most assists in a single-season. In the 2010 NBA Playoffs, the Celtics defeated the Miami Heat in five games and faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round. In Game 2, Rondo dished out 19 assists tying his career-high and also tying a franchise record for most assists in a playoff game. In Game 4, he recorded his fourth postseason triple-double along with a playoff career-high 29 points and 18 rebounds. He joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only other player in NBA history to have 29 points, 18 rebounds and 13 assists in a playoff game. The Celtics eventually defeated the Cavaliers and the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games. In the Finals, the Celtics once again faced the Los Angeles Lakers, a team they previously beat in 2008. In Game 2, Rondo recorded his second triple-double of the postseason (19 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists), however, despite Rondo's performance, the Celtics succumbed to the Lakers in seven games. In the first game of the 2010–11 season, Rondo put up 17 assists, which tied with Oscar Robertson for the third-most assists in a season opener. In the third game of the season, he dished out a career-high 24 assists along with a triple-double (10 points and 10 rebounds) against the New York Knicks. It tied him with Isiah Thomas as the only players in NBA history to have at least 24 assists in a triple-double. His total of 50 assists through the first three games of the season tied John Stockton's NBA record for most assists in the first 3 games of the season. In the next game against the Detroit Pistons, he finished the game with 17 assists for a total of 67 assists, which is the most assists in the team's first four games in NBA history. With a 15 assists effort the following day, Rondo again set a record for most assists through the first five games. Rondo's season also began with injuries. He played through plantar fasciitis in his feet. He missed three games in November due to a strained left hamstring. He sprained his left ankle in a win against the New York Knicks on December 15, 2010, and missed the next seven games. On April 22, in the third game of the first-round playoff series against the New York Knicks, Rondo had a triple-double with 20 assists. Rondo set a Celtics franchise record for most assists in a playoff game. He was also tied with LeBron James with 6 career triple-doubles in the playoffs until James reached his seventh further on in the playoffs during Game 4 of the Finals. Rondo had the third best selling jersey in the league during the 2010–11 season, behind only James and Kobe Bryant. On February 21, 2012, Rondo was named an injury replacement for Joe Johnson on the Eastern Conference roster at the 2012 NBA All-Star Game. With 18 points, 17 rebounds, and 20 assists against the Knicks on March 4, he joined Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, and Jason Kidd as the only players to have at least 15 points, rebounds, and assists in the same game. In a win against the Heat on April 1, Rondo registered another triple-double (16 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds). Rondo closed out the regular season with 24 consecutive games of 10 or more assists. This is not only a Celtics franchise record, but is also the longest streak the NBA has seen since John Stockton logged a streak of 29 such games in 1992. This streak was still considered active and resumed at the beginning of the 2012–13 regular season. Rondo posted his sixth triple-double of the season (with 20 assists) in an overtime win against the Hawks on April 11. He had his first triple double of the 2012 playoffs against the same team on May 4, another on May 13 in the first game of the second round against the 76ers, and a third on May 26 in the last game of that round, helping the Celtics advance to the Eastern Conference finals. He joined Larry Bird as the only Celtics players to record a triple-double in a Game 7. In Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Rondo scored a career-high 44 points while grabbing 8 rebounds and adding 10 assists. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Rondo is the only player in NBA history with 44 points, 10 assists, and 8 rebounds in a playoff game. On June 6, 2012, Rondo passed Bob Cousy for having 39 playoff games of 10 or more assists, making him the Celtics' all-time leader in that area. Rondo recorded another triple double in the seventh game of the Eastern Conference Finals, but the Celtics lost to the Miami Heat, ending their playoff run. This tenth playoff triple-double tied Rondo for third (with fellow Celtic Larry Bird) among NBA career leaders. Rondo began the season with 24 consecutive games of 10+ assists. He continued that streak, and recorded his 37th game with 10+ assists against the Orlando Magic on November 25, 2012, matching John Stockton's longest streak. Only Magic Johnson had a longer streak (46 games). The streak ended the next game against the Brooklyn Nets, when he was ejected for fighting with Kris Humphries after Humphries fouled Rondo's teammate Kevin Garnett. Humphries was also ejected, along with Brooklyn's Gerald Wallace, who was accused of escalating the incident. Rondo only recorded three assists before he was ejected. Rondo was voted the starting point guard spot for the 2013 NBA All-Star Game, but on January 27, 2013, during a game with the Miami Heat, it was revealed that Rondo had torn his ACL and would miss the remainder of the season. Rondo still led the NBA in assists in the season. On January 15, 2014, Rondo was assigned to the Maine Red Claws of the NBA D-League for training and rehab purposes. Later that day, he was recalled by the Celtics. On January 17, 2014, Rondo made his season debut with the Celtics, nearly a year after tearing his ACL. In 19 minutes of game time, he recorded 8 points, 4 assists and 2 rebounds in a 104–107 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Upon his return, he was named the 15th captain in Boston Celtics history. On February 2, 2014, in a 96–89 win over the Magic, Rondo recorded his first double-double since his injury (19 points, 10 assists). On April 4, 2014, Rondo recorded his first triple-double of the season with 11 points, 11 rebounds and 16 assists, in a 102–111 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. On September 26, 2014, Rondo was ruled out for six to eight weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a broken left hand. The injury was a result of a fall at his home the night before. After missing the entire preseason, Rondo returned for the regular season opener on October 29 and recorded 13 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds in 30 minutes to help the Celtics beat the Brooklyn Nets 121–105. On November 5, he recorded 13 points, 10 rebounds and 15 assists against the Toronto Raptors. On December 2, he recorded 19 assists and 12 rebounds against the Atlanta Hawks. On December 7, he recorded 13 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists against the Washington Wizards. On December 10, he recorded 12 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists against the Charlotte Hornets. On December 17, in his final game as a Celtic, Rondo recorded 13 points, 15 assists and seven rebounds in a 109–92 win over the Orlando Magic. On December 18, 2014, Rondo was traded, along with Dwight Powell, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Jae Crowder, Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick and a 2016 second-round pick. He made his debut for the Mavericks two days later, scoring six points on 3-for-11 shooting to go with nine assists and seven rebounds in a 99–93 win over the San Antonio Spurs. In his return to Boston on January 2, 2015, Rondo scored a career-high 15 first-quarter points, finishing with a season-best 29 to lead Dallas to a 119–101 victory. Rondo also had a career-high five 3-pointers and finished with six rebounds and five assists. Throughout January however, cracks began to appear in the relationship between Rondo and the Mavericks. Rondo struggled to fit in the Mavericks' system, and he often butted heads with head coach Rick Carlisle. While there were no reported issues off the court, Rondo's lack of chemistry with his teammates was noticeable throughout the season. And while the Mavericks' defense slightly improved with the acquisition of Rondo, their offense took a noticeable step backward, dropping from the best in the league to fourth in points per game by late February. In late April, Rondo and the Mavericks mutually agreed to part ways following a tumultuous end to the season. Rondo was benched after Game 2 of the Mavericks' first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets and didn't play again as Dallas was eliminated in five games. The team claimed that a back injury had sidelined Rondo indefinitely, but reports later surfaced that that was simply to ""save face"" after the two sides decided to part ways. His teammates also reportedly opted not to give him a playoff share. On July 13, 2015, Rondo signed a one-year, $10 million contract with the Sacramento Kings. He made his debut for the Kings in their season opener on October 28, 2015, recording four points, seven rebounds and four assists in a 111–104 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Two days later, he recorded 21 points and eight assists in a 132–114 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. On November 13, he recorded his third triple-double in four games and 25th of his career with 23 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists in a 111–109 win over the Brooklyn Nets. On November 18, he recorded his fourth triple-double of the season with 12 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a 103–97 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On November 23, he recorded 14 points and a franchise-high 20 assists in a 127–122 overtime loss to the Charlotte Hornets. On November 27, he had 16 points and 16 assists in a 101–91 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He became the first player since 1977–78 to have 16 points, 16 assists and no turnovers in a game. Rondo was ejected from the Kings' December 3 game against the Boston Celtics by Bill Kennedy, and in response, Rondo called Kennedy a ""faggot"". Kennedy publicly came out as gay just over a week later, and Rondo was suspended by the NBA for one game without pay on December 14. After posting two statements on Twitter that were widely panned as not being apologetic, Rondo issued a more contrite apology on December 15. On January 23, 2016, Rondo recorded his fifth triple-double of the season with 11 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 108–97 win over the Indiana Pacers. Two days later, he had 20 assists and 10 rebounds in a 129–128 double-overtime loss to the Hornets, thus recording 10 or more assists in 12 straight games, a Sacramento record. The streak ended at 14 games. On February 19, he recorded a near triple-double with a then season-high 24 points, 10 rebounds, nine assists and five steals in a 116–110 win over the Denver Nuggets. On February 29, Rondo had 11 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds in a 131–116 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. He reached double figures in assists for the 39th time in 2015–16, tying a Sacramento record established by Reggie Theus in 1985–86. On March 25, he had 12 assists against the Phoenix Suns and passed Theus' record. On April 5, he recorded his sixth triple-double of the season with a season-high 27 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 115–107 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, setting a Kings franchise record for triple-doubles in a season. On July 7, 2016, Rondo signed a two-year, $28 million contract with the Chicago Bulls. He made his debut for the Bulls in their season opener on October 27, recording 4 points, 6 rebounds, 9 assists and 2 steals in a 105–99 win over the Boston Celtics. On November 10, he had a then season-best game with 16 points and 12 assists in a 98–95 win over the Miami Heat. On December 2, he recorded his first triple-double of the season with 15 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds in a 111–105 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Three days later, he was suspended by the Bulls for one game for conduct detrimental to the team. On January 10, 2017, Rondo scored 12 points against the Washington Wizards in his first game since December 30. In that December 30 game, he posted a plus-minus rating of minus-20 during 11 first-half minutes in Chicago's 111–101 loss to the Indiana Pacers. He was subsequently removed from coach Fred Hoiberg's rotation for five games before being reinserted following injuries to Dwyane Wade and Jimmy Butler. On March 13, 2017, he scored a season-high 20 points and had six assists and seven rebounds in his first start since December 30 as the Bulls beat the Charlotte Hornets 115–109. He bested that mark on March 21, scoring 24 points in a 122–120 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors. On April 1, he had a season-high 25 points and added 11 rebounds in a 106–104 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On April 21, Rondo was ruled out indefinitely after breaking his right thumb in Game 2 of the Bulls' first-round playoff series against the Celtics. While the Bulls went up 2–0 in the series with Rondo, they never found their rhythm over the final four games without Rondo; as a result, they lost to the Celtics in six games. On June 30, 2017, he was waived by the Bulls. On July 19, 2017, Rondo signed a one-year, $3.3 million contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. On October 8, 2017, he was diagnosed with a sports hernia. Two days later, he underwent surgery and was ruled out for four to six weeks. He made his debut for the Pelicans on November 13, 2017, against the Atlanta Hawks, recording two points and two assists in about five minutes in the first half. He made his first start of the season two days later, recording four points and eight assists in 14 minutes in a 125–116 loss to the Toronto Raptors. On December 10, 2017, he recorded 13 points and 18 assists in a 131–124 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 27, 2017, he set a franchise record with a career-high 25 assists in a 128–113 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He broke Chris Paul's mark with his 22nd assist and became just the seventh player in NBA history to reach 25 assists in a game, joining Scott Skiles, John Stockton, Jason Kidd, Kevin Johnson, Nate McMillan and Isiah Thomas. On January 8, 2018, Rondo had 12 points and 15 assists in a 112–109 win over the Detroit Pistons. He had nine of his assists in the first quarter, tying a franchise record. On February 10, 2018, he recorded 25 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 138–128 double overtime win over the Brooklyn Nets. In the Pelicans' regular season finale on April 11, 2018, Rondo had 19 points and 14 assists in a 122–98 win over the San Antonio Spurs. In Game 1 of the Pelicans' first-round playoff series against the Portland Trail Blazers, Rondo tied a franchise record with 17 assists to go with eight rebounds and six points in a 97–95 win. In Game 2, Rondo had 16 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in a 111–102 win. In Game 4, Rondo had 16 assists, as the Pelicans completed a first-round sweep of the Trail Blazers with a 131–123 victory. In the second round against the Golden State Warriors, Rondo had 21 assists in Game 3, the Pelicans' only win before being eliminated in five games. On July 6, 2018, Rondo signed a one-year, $9 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, who expected him to mentor and compete with second-year point guard Lonzo Ball. In his debut for the Lakers in their season opener on October 18, Rondo recorded 13 points and 11 assists in a 128–119 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. Two days later, in a game against the Houston Rockets, Rondo and Chris Paul got into a fist fight over a shove by Brandon Ingram delivered to James Harden. The conflict, worsened due to Paul's claim that Rondo spat on him, resulted in Rondo receiving a three-game suspension. After breaking his right hand in a 126–117 win over the Trail Blazers on November 14, Rondo was ruled out for four to five weeks. In his return game on December 21 after missing 17 games, Rondo had eight points and nine assists off the bench in a 112–104 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 25 against the Golden State Warriors, after just three games back from his hand injury, Rondo suffered a sprain to his right ring finger. He underwent surgery three days later and was subsequently ruled out for an estimated four to five weeks. He returned to action on January 24, 2019, after missing 14 games, recording 15 points, 13 assists and six rebounds in a 120–105 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. On January 31, he had 14 points and 13 rebounds in a 123–120 overtime win over the Los Angeles Clippers. On February 7, he hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in Boston to lift the Lakers to a 129–128 win over the Celtics, as he finished with 17 points and 10 assists. It was his first career go-ahead field goal in the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. On March 4, Rondo moved to 11th place in triple-doubles in NBA history, while also becoming the second player (the other being Mark Jackson) to record a triple-double with different five teams, when he recorded his 32nd triple-double with a season-high 24 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists as the Lakers lost 113–105 to the Clippers. On March 29, he had 17 assists and five steals in a 123–115 win over the Charlotte Hornets, becoming the first Lakers' player with at least 17 assists and five steals since Magic Johnson in December 1989. On July 8, 2019, Rondo re-signed with the Lakers.",26557,3665,2019-20,38.0,2.0,797.0,5.3,12.3,0.429,1.7,4.7,0.352,3.6,7.6,0.476,1.1,1.5,0.727,0.8,4.9,5.7,9.1,1.4,0.1,3.5,2.2,13.3,14.0,Los Angeles Lakers

He played one year of college basketball for the Memphis Tigers before being drafted first overall by his hometown Chicago Bulls in the 2008 NBA draft.He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year and also became the youngest player to win the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2011 at age 22. Rose was born and raised in Chicago, and attended Simeon Career Academy. He was highly recruited by colleges, eventually choosing to join the University of Memphis under coach John Calipari. Rose led the Tigers to the most wins in NCAA history (a 38–2 record), their first number 1 ranking in 25 years, and an appearance in the NCAA championship game. In 2009, an NCAA investigation revealed that Rose's SAT scores had been invalidated, and as a result, the NCAA vacated Memphis' entire 2007–08 season.Rose has struggled with significant knee injuries since his 2010–11 MVP campaign. In the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose tore his ACL in his left knee. Rose required surgery and was subsequently sidelined for the entire 2012–13 season.Rose returned to play in 2013–14. However, on November 22, 2013, during a regular season game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Rose injured his right meniscus which caused him to miss the remainder of the season.Rose returned once again the following season, but knee injuries continued to riddle him, causing him to miss 30 games. In June 2016, he was traded to the New York Knicks. After one season with the Knicks, Rose joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in July 2017, but was traded and subsequently released by the Utah Jazz the following February. In March 2018, he signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Rose was born and raised in the Englewood area, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side.He is the youngest son of Brenda Rose after Dwayne, Reggie, and Allan. All three were talented basketball players who taught Rose the in and outs of basketball on nearby courts.As his talent for the sport grew, Rose began to attract much more outside attention in Chicago's basketball circles, leading his mother and brothers to restrict outside contact to him. She feared he would be exploited and his path to the NBA diverted by outside parties like street agents, similar to what happened to former Chicago prospect Ronnie Fields.By the time Rose enrolled at Simeon Career Academy in 2003, he was a hot commodity for collegiate coaches. Despite his reputation, he played freshmen and JV basketball for the Wolverines. He wore No. 25 in honor of Ben ""Benji"" Wilson, a promising player who was murdered by a gang member during his senior year in 1984.Rose was not allowed on varsity due to a long-standing tradition that head coach Bob Hambric, who had been with the school since 1980 had no freshmen on the varsity team. That rule did not lessen Rose's play, and he went on to put up 18.5 points, 6.6 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 2.1 steals per game and led both the freshmen and sophomores to city championships with a 24–1 record. Hambric softened his stance and allowed the freshman a chance to play on varsity in the state tournament, but Rose declined, wanting the players to get due credit. The next year Hambric retired and Robert Smith was hired, opening the path to varsity. In Rose's debut, he had 22 points, 7 rebounds and 5 steals over Thornwood High School in a sold-out game filled with college scouts and coaches. He led the Wolverines to a 30–5 mark while averaging 19.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 8.3 assists and 2.4 steals but the season ended after a loss in state regionals. Rose's play garnered him his first national award: a Parade All-American third team spot. During Rose's junior year in 2006, the Simeon Wolverines broke through and won the Chicago Public League championship held at the United Center, where Rose starred with 25 points and crowd pleasing dunks. The team advanced through the playoffs and earned a berth in the Class AA state championship against Richwoods High School, where a fourth quarter buzzer beater by Richwood forced overtime. The score was knotted at 29 late in the extra period when Rose stole the ball and buried the game winning jumper as time expired, giving Simeon its first state title since the Wilson-led Wolverines won in 1984. The team finished 33–4 and ranked nationally, and Rose was awarded with an All-State Illinois mention, EA Sports All-American Second Team pick and another Parade All-American selection. Entering his senior year, Rose was ranked the fifth best prospect in the nation by Sports Illustrated. In January 2007, Simeon traveled to Madison Square Garden to play Rice High School and star guard Kemba Walker. The Wolverines lost 53–51. The season's highlight was a nationally televised contest on ESPN against Virginia perennial power Oak Hill Academy two weeks later. Matched up with hyped junior guard Brandon Jennings, Rose had 28 points, 9 assists, and 8 rebounds and in a 78–75 win. For his performance, USA Today named him their high school player of the week. Simeon went on to repeat as Public League champions and defended their state championship, defeating O'Fallon High School 77–54. In doing so, Simeon became the first Chicago Public League school to win two straight state championships. In his final high school game, Rose scored 2 points, but pulled down 7 rebounds and totaled 8 assists, while Simeon big man Tim Flowers scored 35 points. The Wolverines ended the season 33–2 and ranked first in the nation by Sports Illustrated and 6th on USA Today's Super 25. Rose averaged 25.2 points, 9.1 assists, 8.8 rebounds and 3.4 steals. Overall, Simeon's record while Rose played was 120–12. After his senior year, Rose was again All-State after being named Illinois Mr. Basketball and was named to the McDonald's All-American team. He was also awarded with First Team honors by Parade selection and USA Today and USA Today First Team All-American. Rose was selected to play in the Jordan Brand All-Star Game and Nike Hoop Summit. In 2009, Rose was named the decade's third greatest high school point guard by ESPN RISE magazine behind Chris Paul and T.J. Ford, and had his jersey number (#25) retired along with Ben Wilson. Rose accepted a scholarship to play for the University of Memphis Tigers under John Calipari, who recruited him after seeing him play in an AAU game. Strong efforts were made by Indiana University and in-state University of Illinois to sign Rose to their own programs. Illinois in particular planned to pair Rose and their five-star recruit Eric Gordon, who had played AAU basketball with Rose. Gordon, however, retracted his verbal commitment from the Fighting Illini, opting to play for Indiana, and Rose subsequently gave his verbal commitment before the start of his senior season. Rose chose Memphis because of the school's history of putting players in the NBA and the prospect of Rod Strickland, a 17-year veteran of the league, mentoring him. Rose switched to #23, due to the fact that #25 had been retired by the school in honor of Penny Hardaway. With the addition of Rose and led by veteran upperclassmen Joey Dorsey and Chris Douglas-Roberts, the Tigers started out the season ranked third in the nation. Memphis sprinted to a 26–0 start and claimed the number one ranking in the country for the first time in over 25 years before falling to the University of Tennessee Volunteers 66–62 in February. Memphis was able to bounce back and capture the Conference USA Tournament to qualify for the ""Big Dance"" with a 33–1 record. Rose averaged 14.9 points per game, 4.7 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned All-American Third Team honors among others. He finished as a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award as well as the John R. Wooden Award. Memphis was seeded No. 1 in the South Region. Rose earned high praise for his increased focus on defense, hounding Texas Longhorn guard D. J. Augustin into a low-percentage game in the Elite Eight. In a match-up against UCLA in the Final Four, Rose finished with 25 points and 9 rebounds to lead the Tigers to an 85–67 win and a trip to the NCAA championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks. The win set a NCAA mark for most wins in a season (38). Against Kansas, Rose scored 17 points on 7–of–17 shooting, along with six rebounds and seven assists, but missed a critical free throw at the end of the second half as Memphis fell in overtime, 75–68. Memphis concluded the season 38–2. Rose was named to the All-Final Four team after averaging 20.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game. On April 15, Rose announced he would forgo his final three seasons at Memphis and declared for the 2008 NBA draft. According to Sheri Lipman of the University of Memphis legal counsel, a month after the loss to Kansas, the NCAA sent a letter to the school stating that Rose had ""an invalidated standardized test score the previous year at Chicago's Simeon High School."" The next January, the NCAA sent another letter, charging Memphis with knowing that Rose had someone else take his SAT for him. Memphis started its own investigation and sent its response back on April 24. On May 28, 2009, the Memphis Commercial Appeal obtained the letter through the Freedom of Information Act and released it. Although the player's name was redacted due to privacy laws, process of elimination, and sources revealed the player as Derrick Rose. The next day, in a separate investigation, James Sullivan, Inspector General of the Chicago Public Schools district's Board of Education, released a report of his investigation stating that four student-athletes of a CPS school had one-month grade boosts to alter their college transcripts. The Chicago Sun-Times revealed the school as Simeon Career Academy and that three of the four were Rose and his former teammates Kevin Johnson and Tim Flowers, prominent members of the back-to-back championship teams. The newspaper claimed that Rose's grade was changed from a D to a C. Another part of the report stated that ""high school staff lost the original permanent records for three of the above mentioned students athletes"" (including the unknown four). Sullivan started the investigation because ""none of the grade changes were supported by any documentation."" He also failed to find a suspect as ""at least seven people at Simeon had the ability to access student grades and records."" Illinois High School Association (IHSA) executive director Marty Hickman reacted by saying, ""It is obvious that this is worth taking a look into."" Robert Smith, who coached the Wolverines from 2004 to 2007, denied any wrongdoing. District spokeswoman Monique Bond said the students involved probably did not know about the grade change. Allegations surfaced that Rose's brother, Reggie, had been allowed to travel with the team for free on several occasions. Memphis contended that it had learned of the allegations about Rose's SAT score shortly after he enrolled at the school. It conducted its own investigation, in which Rose was questioned by four school officials. Ultimately, Memphis was unable to find any evidence that Rose had cheated based on what was available at the time and cleared him to play. Rose released a statement through his lawyer Daniel E. Reidy: ""Mr. Rose is aware of the allegations reported in the press. Mr. Rose cooperated fully with the University of Memphis' athletic and legal departments’ investigation of this issue when he was a student, and that investigation uncovered no wrongdoing on his part."" On August 20, 2009, the NCAA vacated Memphis' 2007–08 season. It took the position that because the Educational Testing Service voided Rose's SAT score after Rose's freshman year at Memphis, strict liability required that Rose be retroactively declared ineligible. It also determined that even without the questions about his test score, Rose would have lost his eligibility in December 2007 due to Reggie Rose being allowed to travel for free. On May 28, 2010, Rose, former Memphis basketball coach John Calipari, and Memphis athletic director R.C. Johnson reached a $100,000 out-of-court settlement with three attorneys who represented Memphis season ticket holders and threatened a lawsuit over the vacated 2007–08 season. The Memphis Commercial Appeal first reported on this settlement in October 2011. Rose was selected with the first overall pick in the 2008 draft by the Chicago Bulls. He was selected to the U.S. Select Team to scrimmage against and prepare the National Team for the Olympics in Beijing. In mid-July, he played two games in the Orlando Pro Summer League until forced out by tendinitis in his right knee, ending his summer, but returned in October to play all eight preseason games. Rose became the first Bulls draftee to score 10 points or more in his first 10 games since Michael Jordan, and earned Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors for November and December. During the All-Star Weekend, Rose played in the Rookie Challenge, and won the Skills Challenge, where he beat out several All-Stars to become the first rookie to claim the trophy. Overcoming a January and February slump, Rose returned to form and won monthly rookie honors in March. Meanwhile, the Bulls, re-energized by the trade deadline acquisitions of John Salmons and Brad Miller, finished the regular season on a 12–4 spurt to qualify as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. Rose won Rookie of the Year, joining Michael Jordan (1985) and Elton Brand (2000) as the only Bulls to do so. He was also the first number-one draft pick since LeBron James to win the award. He averaged 16.8 points on 47.5% field goal shooting, 6.3 assists (leading all rookies) and 3.9 rebounds per game and was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. In his playoff debut against the defending champion Boston Celtics, Rose recorded 36 points (tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's NBA record for points scored by a rookie in his playoff debut, set in 1970), 11 assists, and 4 rebounds as the Bulls prevailed in a 105–103 overtime win on the road. Rose became the second player in NBA history to record 35 points and 10 assists in his playoff debut, after Chris Paul. Rose averaged 19.7 points on 47.5% shooting, 6.3 assists and 4.9 rebounds per game in his first playoff series, as the Bulls were defeated by the Celtics in seven games. Rose's sophomore season started off with an ankle injury in his first preseason game. Rose would go on to miss the rest of the preseason. Rose started the Bulls' season opener against the San Antonio Spurs but played limited minutes. Rose's ankle bothered him for most of November, but as his ankle healed, his game improved. On January 28, 2010, Rose was elected to his first career All-Star Game as a reserve for the Eastern Conference, making him the first Bulls player to be selected since Michael Jordan in 1998. Rose ended up with eight points, four assists and three steals in the game. On April 13, 2010, Rose scored 39 points against the Celtics, making 15–22 field goals and 9–10 free throws. The Bulls once again made the playoffs in the 2009–10 season, finishing with a 41–41 record. In the playoffs Rose averaged 26.8 points and 7.2 assists, but the Bulls lost in five games to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On October 30, 2010, in the Bulls' second game of the season, Rose scored 39 points in a 101–91 win against the Detroit Pistons. Two days after, Rose contributed 13 assists, helping Luol Deng score a career high 40 points in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers. On December 10, Rose scored 29 points and had 9 assists, leading the Bulls to their first victory over the Los Angeles Lakers since December 19, 2006. On January 17, 2011, Rose recorded his first career triple-double with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 96–84 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. On January 27, he was announced as a starting guard on the 2011 NBA All-Star Team for the East squad. On February 17, in the Bulls' last game before the All-Star break, Rose set a career-high with 42 points, while also recording 8 assists and 5 rebounds, as the Bulls beat the San Antonio Spurs 109–99. On March 26, Rose had a career high 17 assists, along with 30 points, in a 95–87 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. At the end of the 2010–11 NBA season the Bulls finished with a league leading record of 62–20. Their 60+ wins was the Bulls' first such season since 1997–98 and sixth 60+ win in franchise history. At season's end, Rose became only the third player since the 1972–73 NBA season to record 2,000 points and 600 assists in a single season. The other two players were LeBron James and Michael Jordan. On May 3, Rose was named the NBA Most Valuable Player, joining Michael Jordan as the only players to receive the award in Chicago Bulls history. At 22 years and 6 months old, Rose also became the youngest player to receive the award (Wes Unseld, formerly the youngest MVP, won the award in 1968–69 at age 23 years, 2 months). In the 2011 NBA Playoffs, the Bulls defeated the Indiana Pacers and Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Bulls faced the Miami Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. The Bulls lost the series in five games. During the 2011 playoffs, Rose averaged 27.1 points per game, but only shot 39% from the field and 24% for three-pointers. In December 2011, Rose signed a five-year contract extension with the Bulls for $94.8 million. The contract was 30 percent of the Bulls' salary cap, the maximum allowed under a rule dubbed the ""Derrick Rose Rule"" from the 2011 NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement. Rose was voted as an All-Star Game starter for the second consecutive year. He was the second leading vote getter behind Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. He averaged 21.8 ppg, along with a career high 7.9 apg in 35.3 mpg, but played a career low 39 games due to injuries. He helped Luol Deng become an All-Star for the first time in his career. During Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose injured his left knee while trying to jump. He was immediately helped off the court. The injury occurred when the Bulls were leading by 12 points with 1:22 left to play. Rose came up just short of a triple-double, finishing with 23 points, 9 assists, and 9 rebounds in 37 minutes of action. An MRI later revealed that Rose tore the ACL in his left knee and would miss the rest of the playoffs. Rose had surgery performed on May 12, 2012, with an estimated recovery period of 8–12 months.Rose returned to full contact practice in January 2013, and was cleared by doctor to play that March, but he did not appear in a game during the 2012–13 NBA season. Despite Rose's absence, the Bulls advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where they lost to the eventual champions, the Miami Heat. Rose's much awaited return came on October 5, 2013, in a pre-season game against the Indiana Pacers. He had a slow start but scored his first point in the first quarter. He finished the game with 13 points in 20 minutes of play. On October 16, 2013, Rose returned to play in Chicago for the first time, scoring 22 points against the Detroit Pistons. ""I think I'm way more explosive now. Like getting to the rim. I think I can take contact a little bit better. And as far as jumping-wise, I think I can jump even higher. They tested my vertical -- I increased it by 5 inches"", Rose said after the win. During the pre-season, Rose averaged 20.7 points and 5 assists. His first official game was in 107–95 loss against the defending champions Miami Heat on October 29. Rose was limited to 12 points, while having 4 assists in 34 minutes of play. He played his usual minutes, but was inefficient from the field, shooting 4–15. Two days later, he played his first official home game against the New York Knicks where he hit the game-winning floater in an 82–81 win. He had 18 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists. On November 3, 2013, Rose scored 13 points and committed 8 turnovers in the loss against the Philadelphia 76ers. He struggled in his return, shooting 28.8% from the field and averaging 5.7 turnovers in his first three games. On November 22, Rose injured his right knee during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers. An MRI the next day confirmed that Rose tore his right knee meniscus and that surgery was required. At the time, Rose was averaging 15.9 points and 4.3 assists in 31.1 minutes per game. On November 25, Rose underwent surgery on the torn meniscus in his right knee.The same day, the Bulls announced Rose was out for the season, after a successful surgery. Rose returned from injury to play in the Bulls' season opener against the New York Knicks on October 29, 2014 and recorded 13 points and 5 assists in 21 minutes of action. He went on to score a season-high 32 points on January 14 against the Washington Wizards, before being ruled out again with another knee injury a month later. He appeared in 51 games, the most he'd played since the 2010–11 season. On February 24, it was announced Rose required another round of surgery on his right knee and was ruled out indefinitely. An exam and subsequent MRI confirmed a medial meniscus tear of the right knee, the same injury he sustained on November 22, 2013 against the Portland Trail Blazers. On February 27, he was deemed a possibility of returning toward the end of the season after he underwent successful surgery and was ruled out for just four to six weeks. Rose returned to action on April 8 after a 20-game absence, and working on a minutes restriction, he was 3-of-9 from the field and finished with nine points in 19 minutes as the Bulls lost to the Orlando Magic. On April 18, Rose played in his first playoff game since Game 1 of the 2012 playoffs (the game where he tore his left ACL). Rose finished with 23 points and 7 assists on 9-of-16 shooting. During the Bulls' first round series against the Bucks, Rose averaged 21.5 points per game. On May 8, Rose banked in a three-pointer at the buzzer and scored 30 points to give the Bulls a 99-96 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers and a 2-1 lead in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. However, the Cavaliers won the final three games to take the series in six games. A preseason left orbital bone fracture saw Rose begin the regular season wearing a face mask. On November 5, 2015, Rose scored a then season-high 29 points on 12-of-25 shooting in a 104–98 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. He showed signs of his old MVP self as he scored 10 points over the final three and a half minutes to lift the Bulls after they blew a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter. On December 18, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 147–144 quadruple overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons. On February 5, 2016, he had a season-best game with 30 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists in a 115–110 loss to the Denver Nuggets. On June 22, 2016, Rose was traded, along with Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick, to the New York Knicks in exchange for future teammate José Calderón, Jerian Grant and Robin Lopez. He made his debut for the Knicks in the team's season opener on October 25 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 29 minutes of action, he scored 17 points on 7-of-17 shooting in a 117–88 loss.

On November 17, he scored a season-high 27 points in a 119–112 loss to the Washington Wizards. He topped that mark on November 28, scoring 30 points in a 112–103 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On January 10, 2017, Rose was fined an undisclosed amount after he reportedly flew to Chicago to be with his mother but did not notify team officials ahead of their game against the New Orleans Pelicans on January 9. Eight days later, he matched his season high with 30 points in a 117–106 win over the Boston Celtics. On April 2, 2017, he was ruled out for the rest of the season after tearing the meniscus in his left knee, necessitating a fourth round of knee surgery for Rose in his nine-year career. On July 25, 2017, Rose signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his debut for the Cavaliers in their season opener against the Boston Celtics on October 17, 2017, Rose scored 14 points in a 102–99 win. On November 24, 2017, Rose left the team to re-evaluate his future in the NBA. His increasing frustration with injuries caused him to question his desire to continue playing. He returned to working with the Cavaliers' medical staff in early December in hopes of recovering from a sprained left ankle and bone spurs. On January 18, 2018, Rose returned to the line-up after missing more than two months with ankle injuries and scored nine points in 13 minutes in a 104–103 win over the Orlando Magic. On February 8, 2018, Rose was acquired by the Utah Jazz in a three-team trade that also involved the Cavaliers and the Sacramento Kings. Two days later, he was waived by the Jazz. On March 8, 2018, Rose signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves, reuniting him with Tom Thibodeau, Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson. In the playoffs, Rose averaged 14.2 points in 23.8 minutes per game, as the Timberwolves lost 4–1 to the Houston Rockets in the first round. On July 4, 2018, Rose re-signed with the Timberwolves for the 2018–19 season. On October 31, in his first start of the season, Rose scored a career-high 50 points in a 128–125 win over the Utah Jazz, securing the victory with a block on Utah's final shot as time expired. On December 26, he had 24 points and eight assists and received MVP chants in a 119–94 win over the Bulls in Chicago. It was just his second career game in the United Center against his former team. On January 15 against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose reached 10,000 career points. On January 20, he scored 29 of his 31 points in the second half and hit an 18-footer with 0.6 seconds left to give the Timberwolves a 116–114 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Right ankle trouble saw Rose miss 11 of 19 games spanning late December to late January. He missed an additional three games in early February. On March 21, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a right elbow injury. On July 7, 2019, Rose signed with the Detroit Pistons. Rose became the first player in Pistons’ history to record seven consecutive 20+ point games as a reserve which also coincides in his career-high 14-streak of scoring 20 points or more. The streak ended after suffering a groin injury during a game with the Denver Nuggets. Rose was a member of the United States men's national basketball teams that won gold medals at the 2010 and 2014 FIBA World Cup. Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and weighing 200 pounds (91 kg), Rose plays mostly at the point guard position. He averages 18.8 points per game for his career. He has never been a knock-down shooter from the arc, shooting 30 percent for his career. He developed into a bank-shot shooter during the 2015–16 season after struggling with his jump shot due to what he attributes to depth perception issues following eye surgery in 2015. His agent is former Bulls guard B. J. Armstrong. Rose is a Christian. Rose has spoken about his faith saying, ""... God does everything for a reason."" Rose wears a wristband that says ""In Jesus Name I Play"" and has several tattoos about his faith. On October 9, 2012, Rose's girlfriend, Mieka Reese, gave birth to their son, Derrick Jr. In 2018, Rose introduced The Rose Scholars program, a scholarship program to help students achieve a higher education. In 2016, Rose was involved in a federal civil lawsuit to ""assess whether he and two friends raped his former girlfriend"" in August 2013. In the months before the alleged gang-rape, Rose's accuser, referred to as ""Jane Doe"" in court transcripts, testified that Rose made her uncomfortable by asking her to perform sexual acts for him or to involve other people in their sex life; he would sometimes get angry when she refused. Jane Doe also mentioned that on the day of the incident, she was drugged against her consent, and alternated in and out of consciousness. During the trial, Rose expressed difficulty and uncertainty with the definition of the word ""consent"". In October 2016, he was found not liable by an eight-member jury. An appeal in 2018 was denied. Rose was the cover athlete of NBA 2K13 alongside fellow NBA players Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin. Rose was the lone cover athlete for the 2K Sports Downloadable Content game, NBA 2K10 Draft Combine, which was released on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3. Rose is a part-owner and spokesman for the Chicago-based Giordano's Pizzeria. In 2008, Rose signed a shoe deal with Adidas for $1 million per year. He has also signed with Wilson Sporting Goods.

In 2011, Rose was estimated by Crain's Chicago Business to earn $1.5–$2.5 million annually in endorsements, ranking just outside the top 10 NBA players in that category. In 2012, it was reported that Rose signed a contract extension with Adidas, worth $185 million over 14 years.",26558,3668,2019-20,46.0,11.0,1203.0,10.1,20.8,0.488,1.2,4.1,0.299,8.9,16.7,0.535,3.3,3.8,0.859,0.7,2.6,3.3,7.9,1.1,0.4,3.4,1.4,24.8,9.0,Detroit Pistons

He played two years of college basketball for Louisville before being selected with the 16th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. Rozier was born in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1994. His father, Terry Rozier Sr., was sent to prison for eight years only two months after his birth.Then, in 2005, Terry spent a few months with his father, who had just been released from prison, before he was arrested again on charges of involuntary manslaughter for his involvement in a robbery and kidnapping from 2003 that had led to the accidental death of an accomplice.Rozier Sr. was then sentenced to thirteen years. In consequence, Rozier was raised primarily by his mother, Gina Tucker, and his grandmother, Amanda Tucker,as well as alongside his brother and half sister.Rozier starred at Shaker Heights High School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, graduating in 2012. In his senior year, he averaged 25.6 points, 6.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 4.7 steals per game while leading Shaker to a 21–3 record and taking them in 2012 to the regional semifinals for the first time since 2002.

On June 25, 2015, Rozier was selected by the Boston Celtics with the 16th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft. On July 27, 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Celtics. Entering his rookie season, he drew comparisons to Damian Lillard. During his rookie season, he received multiple assignments to the Maine Red Claws, Boston's D-League affiliate. He appeared in 39 regular season games for the Celtics in 2015–16, scoring a season-high seven points twice. In his first playoff game, he scored 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting against the Atlanta Hawks. On November 12, 2016, Rozier scored a career-high 11 points in a 105–99 win over the Indiana Pacers.

Rubio became the youngest player ever to play in the Spanish ACB League on October 15, 2005, at age 14.He made his EuroLeague debut on October 24, 2006, at age 16, becoming the first player born in the 1990s to play in a EuroLeague game.He is the fifth-youngest player to make their debut in the EuroLeague, since the year 2000. On June 25, 2009, he was drafted with the fifth pick in the first round of the 2009 NBA draft by the Timberwolves,making him the first player born in the 1990s to be drafted by the NBA. The Timberwolves had an agreement in principle with his former Spanish team, DKV Joventut, to buy out his contract, but Rubio backed out of the deal.On August 31, 2009, Joventut traded the rights to Rubio to FC Barcelona,and Rubio signed a six-year contract with FC Barcelona the following day.In 2011, Rubio joined the Minnesota Timberwolves,and spent six seasons in Minnesota before being traded to the Jazz in June 2017. He signed with the Phoenix Suns in July 2019. Rubio was regarded by some as the best European guard prospect ever. Rubio has been compared by some to Pete Maravich. On June 24, 2009, the Minnesota Timberwolves acquired the 5th pick in the 2009 NBA draft, Etan Thomas, Darius Songaila and Oleksiy Pecherov from the Washington Wizards, in exchange for Randy Foye and Mike Miller. With the 5th pick, Minnesota selected Rubio, making him the first player born in the 1990s to be drafted. The Timberwolves had a total of four first round picks in the 2009 NBA draft. They used the 6th and 18th picks in the first round and chose two other point guards, Jonny Flynn from Syracuse and Ty Lawson from North Carolina, surprising many in the NBA. Lawson's draft rights were soon traded to the Denver Nuggets. The Timberwolves then used the 28th pick to select Wayne Ellington, a shooting guard from North Carolina. The following day, Rubio's father told a Spanish media outlet his son might return to Spain for at least one more season. Rubio did not attend an introductory press conference by the Timberwolves. Rubio had a buyout clause in his Joventut contract reported by various media outlets as ranging from $6.6 million to $8.2 million, and Timberwolves general manager David Kahn admitted Rubio would probably have to play one more season in Spain to reduce or avoid the buyout. On July 22, the Associated Press reported Rubio was seeking to leave Joventut, regardless of whether he was able to come to the NBA. The report indicated that the ACB powers FC Barcelona and Real Madrid were both interested in signing Rubio if he could not immediately go to the NBA. The main stumbling block to Rubio's NBA move was a clause in the league's collective bargaining agreement that prohibited a team from paying more than $500,000 toward a player's contract buyout. Barça and Real, as ACB clubs, were not subject to this rule and could pay far more toward a buyout. In another development, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported on August 4 Rubio's representatives had been actively seeking endorsement deals in Minnesota to help finance his buyout (the NBA buyout rules are binding on teams, but not on third parties). However, on August 31, 2009, ESPN reported Rubio would not come to the NBA until 2011 at the earliest.Joventut expressed a willingness to reduce the buyout, and the Timberwolves apparently had a deal to bring him to the NBA, but in the end Rubio did not feel ready to cross the Atlantic. Rubio issued the following statement:Kahn believed Rubio and his family were being pressured by the Spanish media, his national teammates, and people in his hometown to stay in Spain, adding, ""It's just been a tough summer. From an 18-year-old's perspective and his family's perspective, it was very nerve-racking"".ESPN reported his original buyout with Joventut was €5.7 million ($8.1 million) in both 2009 and 2010.Barça bought out Rubio's contract for €3.5 million ($5.0 million), and announced on September 1 he had signed a six-year deal with the club. The contract gave him the option to go to the NBA after the 2010–11 season, with ESPN reporting the buyout at that time would be a more manageable $1.4 million (of which the Timberwolves could pay $500,000).Rubio debuted in the Spanish ACB League in the 2005–06 season with DKV Joventut. Rubio was the youngest player ever to debut in the ACB, at 14 years and 11 months. He won the FIBA EuroChallenge championship with Joventut that year. He led the Spanish ACB League in steals during the 2006–07 season. He also won the Spanish ACB League's Rising Star Award that season. Rubio was also named the FIBA Europe Young Player of the Year in 2007, 2008, and 2009. He made his EuroLeague debut on October 24, 2006, versus Panathinaikos of Athens as Joventut's backup point guard for Elmer Bennett. He became the fifth-youngest EuroLeague player at the time. Rubio averaged 2.8 assists per game in his first season of EuroLeague play. He won the EuroCup championship with Joventut in 2008. He was also voted the Spanish ACB League's best point guard in 2008 and 2010. He won the 2009–10 EuroLeague with FC Barcelona. Despite his notability, he was carefully shielded. DKV Joventut and Rubio's parents agreed not to make him available for interviews until his 18th birthday on October 21, 2008. The restrictions were ended a few months early once he was selected for the Spain national team that would play at the 2008 Olympics. Rubio won the 2008 Mr. Europa Award, which was given out yearly by the Italian Superbasket Magazine. In 2009, his club Badalona raised the amount of money his contract paid per year from 80,000 euros net income to 300,000 euros net income. He was named the Defensive Player of the Year for the Spanish ACB League 2008–09 season, and he also led the league in steals that season. Rubio declared himself eligible for the 2009 NBA draft on April 20, 2009. Rubio's agent during that time was Dan Fegan. After the 2009 NBA draft, Rubio played for the Regal FC Barcelona for the next two seasons as agreed upon with the Minnesota Timberwolves. During that time, he helped the team win the EuroLeague Championship in 2010 and the Liga ACB Championship in 2011. On June 1, 2011, sources reported Rubio had ""reached an agreement with Minnesota to join the Timberwolves"" for the 2011–12 NBA season.Rubio arrived off a plane in Minnesota to a barrage of fans waiting to welcome him to America.

He speaks French, Italian and English.Sefolosha was invited to join the junior Swiss national basketball team, and at 17 he began a professional career with Tege Riviera Basket, in Switzerland's top domestic league.On a team trip to France, Sefolosha was approached by a French talent scout to play with Elan Chalon in the premier pro league in France.Sefolosha spent his first year in Chalon-sur-Saône playing with the junior under-21 squad, which traveled alongside the senior club. The following year (2002–03), he earned a rotation spot on the senior club, where he played 30 games and averaged 4 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1 assist per game.The following season, Sefolosha earned a starting spot on the senior team, which he helped lead to a third-place finish in the French league, where his team advanced to the playoffs semifinals. During the season, he averaged 9.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30.7 minutes per game.Before the start of his fourth season with Elan Chalon, a contract dispute between Sefolosha and the team arose. Sefolosha's agent and the team president could not reach an agreement on a new contract, so Sefolosha signed with Italian team Angelico Biella. ""Last summer, I had the chance to re-negotiate my contract with the club. We were supposed to reach an agreement, but when my agent and the president started talking, they couldn't agree on a contract. They wanted to keep me, but at the same time I had this offer from Italy. That's when I decided that the best thing for my career was to play in Biella. Yes, there was a little bit of trouble, but in the end it was OK.""Sefolosha was taken with the 13th pick of the 2006 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers and promptly traded to the Chicago Bulls for the 16th pick (Rodney Carney), and cash considerations.In an article on Bulls.com, Sefolosha was quoted saying ""I was certainly surprised (at the draft) when someone came up and said that I was the next to be picked. I thought maybe he had made a mistake or something. But a few minutes later he came back and told me that not only was I going to be picked, but that I was going to be traded to Chicago, which really got me excited.""Former Bulls head coach Scott Skiles cited Sefolosha's wingspan and past pro basketball experience as reasons why the Bulls were interested in him. ""Thabo's got great physical gifts that, frankly, a lot of guys in the league just don't have. He's got tremendous length and has really quick hands, he grabs your attention whenever you watch him play. It's easy to see that he knows what he's doing out there. You can tell he likes to play defense, too. He's eager to get after it.""After the NBA summer leagues finished, ESPN asked several NBA talent scouts and executives to rank the summer league players and Sefolosha scored high. ""He excelled at just about everything"", reported one of the professionals. ""Thabo Sefolosha showed that he's going to be able to step in right away and contribute to the Bulls.""On February 19, 2009, the trade deadline, Sefolosha was traded by the Bulls to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Denver's 2009 first-round draft pick, which Chicago used to draft Taj Gibson.Sefolosha was selected to the All-NBA Defensive Second Team for the 2009–10 NBA season. In October 2011, during the 2011 NBA lockout, Sefolosha signed with Fenerbahçe Ülker in Turkey, but only for Euroleague matches. His deal had an out-clause that allowed him to return to Oklahoma City at the end of the lockout.He played 7 matches with Fenerbahçe Ülker during the 2011–12 Euroleague season. In 2012, Sefolosha and the Thunder reached the NBA Finals, but were defeated by the Miami Heat. On July 15, 2014, Sefolosha was acquired by the Atlanta Hawks in a sign-and-trade deal, along with rights to Giorgos Printezis, in exchange for the rights to Sofoklis Schortsanitis.On January 31, 2015, he was ruled out for six to eight weeks with a strained right calf.On April 9, he was ruled out for the rest of the regular season due to a fractured tibia suffered while being arrested by members of the New York City Police Department. On July 18, 2017, Sefolosha signed a multi-year deal with the Utah Jazz. On January 12, 2018, in Utah's 99–88 loss to the Charlotte Hornets, Sefolosha suffered a right MCL injury. He underwent season-ending surgery five days later. On April 3, 2018, he was suspended without pay for five games for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program. On September 23, 2019, Sefolosha signed a one-year deal with the Houston Rockets. Note: The EuroLeague is not the only competition in which the player participated for the team during the season. He also played in domestic competition, and regional competition if applicable. On April 8, 2015, Sefolosha and teammate Pero Antić were arrested outside a nightclub in New York City for allegedly interfering with police after Chris Copeland of the Indiana Pacers was stabbed in the abdomen following an argument. During the altercation, the NYPD officers broke Sefolosha's right leg, shutting him down for the rest of the season. He underwent surgery on April 16, to repair a fractured tibia and ligament damage. The prosecution offered Sefolosha a plea bargain, which would have involved a dismissal of the charges after six months, but Sefolosha refused it on September 9, 2015, even though his attorney, Alex Spiro, urged him to take it. Sefolosha said that he wanted to let the case proceed to trial instead; at the same time, charges against Antić were dropped. Sefolosha's court hearing was set on October 5, 2015. On October 9, a Manhattan jury found him not guilty of all three misdemeanor charges: obstructing government administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. On October 21, 2015, Sefolosha announced he would be suing the city of New York as well as eight police officers for up to $50 million in damages. On April 9, 2017, it was announced Sefolosha had settled with the NYPD for $4 million, a ""substantial portion"" of which he donated to Gideon's Promise, a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating public defenders. In October 2017, Sefolosha revealed that he saved a woman the previous month from drowning while he and his family were on a rafting trip down the Provo River.",26572,3814,2019-20,39.0,0.0,417.0,3.2,7.7,0.416,1.3,4.6,0.283,1.9,3.1,0.611,0.3,0.7,0.375,1.8,6.0,7.8,2.1,2.0,1.0,1.2,3.6,7.9,11.0,Houston Rockets

He played college basketball for the Alabama Crimson Tide. In January 2017 Sexton was selected as a McDonald's All-American.He was selected with the 8th pick in the 2018 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Collin is the son of Darnell and Gia Sexton.

Following Alabama's loss in the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, Sexton announced his intention to forgo his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility and declare for the 2018 NBA draft, where he was expected to be a first round selection. Before Alabama's exhibition game on November 6, 2017, the school announced that Sexton would not play due to eligibility concerns. These concerns stem from Alabama director of basketball operations Kobie Baker's resignation following an internal investigation after the announcement of an FBI investigation into college basketball corruption. Sexton would, however, make his debut with Alabama on November 14 in a win against Lipscomb University. Later on in February 2018, Sexton's name would pop up as one of the names implicated with the NCAA scandal of receiving payments or dinners. His name was once again cleared.

In the week of March 8, 2019, Sexton had the best week of his rookie campaign, averaging 26.0 points, 3.8 assists, and 2.5 rebounds. During a stretch from March 8 to March 22, he became the first rookie to score 23+ points in seven consecutive games since Tim Duncan in 1998, as well the only rookie in franchise history to successively score at least 23 points. Additionally, he is the only rookie in NBA history to have played at least 2,000 minutes while scoring over 16 points per game on over 40% 3-point accuracy and fewer than 3 turnovers. On November 10, 2019, Sexton set a new career high of 31 points en route to a 108–87 rout of the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden.

Siakam played college basketball for the New Mexico State Aggies and was named the Western Athletic Conference Player of the Year in 2016. Nicknamed ""Spicy P"", he was selected by Toronto with the 27th overall pick in the first round of the 2016 NBA draft. After being assigned to the NBA Development League (now the G League) as a rookie in 2017, he led Toronto’s affiliate team to a league championship and picked up Finals Most Valuable Player honors in the process. Siakam would later help the Raptors claim an NBA championship in 2019 while winning the league's Most Improved Player Award in the same season, the first player to win both during the same season. He was named an NBA All-Star for the first time in the 2019-20 season. Siakam was born in Douala, Cameroon, to Tchamo and Victorie Siakam, the youngest of four brothers. His father, Tchamo, worked for a local transit company and was also the mayor of Makénéné. According to a story by Jackie MacMullan of ESPN, Pascal was effectively ""hand-picked to embody his family's Catholicism."" His father thus enrolled him in St. Andrew's Seminary in Bafia at age eleven. The academic star of the family, Siakam originally wanted to become a Catholic priest; but by age fifteen, he had a change of heart. Siakam initially had little interest in basketball in stark contrast to his older brothers, all of whom earned scholarships with the sport to various NCAA Division I colleges.He was discovered as a player at a local camp by Luc Mbah a Moute, whose parents' home in Bafia was about 2 miles (3 km) from St. Andrew's. Siakam attended Mbah a Moute's camp for the first time in 2011, a year before graduating from St. Andrew's; and he returned to it the following year, after which he was selected to attend the Basketball Without Borders camp. There, despite having had virtually no basketball experience at the time, he gained attention for his apparent athleticism and extremely high energy level. As Raptors president Masai Ujiri, who had been at this camp, recalled, ""His effort was memorable.""With Mbah a Moute as a mentor, Siakam moved to the United States at the age of sixteen. He went from one camp to the next to hone his skills before settling in Lewisville, Texas, and attending God's Academy. While at this prep school, Siakam was neither widely known nor initially eligible. But he was at least pursued by New Mexico State University; the Aggies' coach had Siakam on his radar since his pipeline of connections spanned several continents and his roster reserved fourteen spots for foreign-born players.Siakam enrolled at New Mexico State University in 2013. After redshirting the 2013–14 season due to injury, he worked his way onto the Aggies' starting lineup and then to Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year honors by the 2014–15 campaign. For the 2015–16 campaign, he averaged 20.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks across 34 games en route to earning unanimous WAC Player of the Year honors.On April 19, 2016, Siakam declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final two years of college eligibility.On June 23, 2016, Siakam was selected by the Toronto Raptors with the 27th overall pick in the NBA draft,with the franchise signing him to a rookie scale contract on July 9.On October 2, he became the first rookie to start for the Raptors' season-opener since Jonas Valančiūnas did so in 2012; rising to the occasion, he hauled in 9 rebounds and notched 4 points in 21 minutes as Toronto beat the Detroit Pistons, 109–91.It marked not only his NBA debut, but the first NBA game that he had ever seen in person.On December 3, Siakam scored a season-high 14 points, which came in a 128–84 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.On January 1, 2017, during a 123–114 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, he pulled down a season-high 10 rebounds.In his rookie season, Siakam started in as many as 38 games at power forward, including the first 35 of the 2016–17 campaign, because Jared Sullinger was out with injury;he was later replaced on the starting lineup by Lucas Nogueira on January 5, 2017. From February 21 through April 28, he was alternately assigned to the Raptors 905 of the D-League and recalled from it. Accordingly, between games played for the Raptors, he led Toronto's affiliate team to the Finals and helped them win a title by defeating the Rio Grande Valley Vipers 2–1. After averaging 23 points and 9 rebounds in that series, he was named the D-League Finals MVP. In his second year in the NBA, Siakam cemented himself as a productive bench contributor for Toronto.He recorded a then career-high 20 points during a 117–112 loss to the Golden State Warriors on October 25, 2017. For the 2017–18 season, the Raptors' offensive rating was four points better with Siakam on the floor, compared to seven points worse his rookie year. His averages improved from 4.3 points per game to 7.3, from 3.4 rebounds per game to 4.5, and from 0.3 assists per game to 2.0.He would draw comparisons to Warriors' forward Draymond Green for such qualities as his rare ability to guard all positions, his shrewd basketball IQ, and internal confidence. Heading into the 2018-19 campaign, Siakam emerged as a two-way force, and he would average 16.9 points a night to go along with 6.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists; he would also make a marked improvement in shooting from distance, increasing his three-point percentage by 14 points to 36 percent.He surpassed his previous career-high on October 29, 2018, by posting 22 points during a 124–109 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. On November 10, he set a new career-high with 23 points scored in a 128–112 victory over the New York Knicks. Siakam was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played November 5 to 11, thus becoming the eighth Raptor in franchise history to earn the award after DeMar DeRozan (10 times), Vince Carter (7 times), Chris Bosh (7 times), Kyle Lowry (4 times), Mike James, Jalen Rose, and Lou Williams. On January 13, Siakam recorded 24 points and a career-high 19 rebounds in a 140–138 double-overtime win versus the Washington Wizards. On February 13, he racked up a new career-high 44 points and hit a career-best 4 three-pointers in a 129–120 win over the Wizards; he thus became the 11th Raptor in franchise history to reach the 40-point plateau. In Game 3 of the Raptors' first-round playoff series against the Orlando Magic, Siakam tallied 30 points and 11 rebounds in the 98–93 victory. In Game 1 of the second round, Siakam posted 29 points in a 108–95 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. In Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Siakam helped Toronto defeat Milwaukee in double-overtime, 118–112, putting up 25 points and bringing down 11 rebounds; the win cut the Bucks' series lead to 2–1. In Game 6, Siakam converted 18 points for his part in the 100–94 win over Milwaukee; the victory clinched the series and propelled the Raptors to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history. In Game 1 of the 2019 Finals, Siakam scored a playoff career-high 32 points in a 118–109 victory over the Golden State Warriors. He went on to help the Raptors defeat the Warriors in six games and thus capture their first NBA Championship in franchise history. At the 2019 Awards ceremony later that month, Siakam was named the NBA's Most Improved Player for the 2018–19 season. On October 19, 2019, Siakam agreed to a four-year, $130 million extension with Toronto. Siakam recorded 34 points, 18 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 block in 38 minutes played of the NBA's season-opening game to help the Raptors beat the New Orleans Pelicans 130-122. He also matched his career-highs in both offensive rebounds and made free throws, and set a new career-high in field goals attempted. On Thursday January 23rd, it was announced that Siakam will be a starter in his first-ever all-star game. Siakam is the son of Tchamo Siakam, the former mayor of Makénéné, Cameroon, and Victorie Siakam. His father died in a car crash in October 2014. To this day, one of Siakam's greatest regrets is that he was unable to attend his father's funeral because it occurred while he was waiting for the issuance of a new US visa.His three older brothers, Boris, Christian, and James, all played NCAA Division I basketball in the United States—Boris at Western Kentucky, Christian at IUPUI, and James at Vanderbilt.

He played college basketball for one season with the Louisiana State University (LSU) Tigers, after which he was named a consensus first-team All-American and the USBWA National Freshman of the Year. Simmons was selected with the first overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft by the 76ers. After sitting out a year due to an injured right foot, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2018. Simmons received his first All-Star selection in 2019. Simmons attended Box Hill Senior Secondary College before moving to the United States to attend Montverde Academy in Montverde, Florida. In his only season in college, LSU began the season with high expectations, but failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament. Simmons left school to enter the NBA draft, becoming the third Melbourne-born number one overall pick (following Andrew Bogut and Kyrie Irving) in 11 years. Simmons is the son of an American-born father, Dave, who played pro basketball in Australia. A dual citizen of Australia and the United States, Simmons has played for the Australian national team. Simmons was born in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy to father Dave and mother Julie.His father is an African-American expatriate who became a naturalised citizen of Australia,and his mother is a white Australian.He was raised alongside five brothers and sisters—Melissa, Emily, Liam, Sean, and Olivia—the first four being from his mother's previous marriage.His father played college basketball for Oklahoma City University in the United States before turning professional with the Melbourne Tigers in Australia's National Basketball League in 1989.Simmons was raised in Newcastle from the age of 18 months while his father played and coached in the city. Simmons began playing basketball at the age of seven in the Newcastle Hunters' under-12 representative team and played two more years for Lake Macquarie and Newcastle.While in Newcastle, he also played junior rugby league. At age 10, Simmons returned to Melbourne and began playing junior basketball for the Knox Raiders. Along with basketball, he also played Australian rules football at the junior level. In Year 7, while attending Whitefriars College, Simmons was named MVP after he helped Whitefriars win the Year-7 Division 1A Basketball premiership. As a teenager, Simmons was torn between his two loves of basketball and Australian rules football, but eventually decided to focus on basketball. In Year 9, at the age of 15, Simmons played basketball for Box Hill Senior Secondary College at the 2011 Australian Schools Championships before taking up a scholarship at the Australian Institute of Sport in 2012. Later that year, Simmons made his first appearance in the United States at the renowned Pangos All-American Camp for basketball prospects. Despite being only 15 years old, he was chosen to represent Australia at the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship. In January 2013, Simmons moved to the U.S. to compete against boys of comparable size and athleticism. He attended Montverde Academy in Montverde, Florida, where he immediately started playing. In April 2013, he helped Montverde rally from a 16-point deficit to beat New Jersey's St Benedict's 67–65 in the final of the High School National Tournament. After competing in the Jordan Brand Classic International Game, he returned to Melbourne where he joined the Bulleen Boomers of the Big V competition in June 2013. He played six games for Bulleen while averaging 12.3 points, 8.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.3 steals, and 2.3 blocks per game. Simmons returned to Montverde Academy for his junior season in 2013–14. On the season, Simmons averaged 18.5 points, 9.8 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game while shooting 69 percent from the field and 77 percent from the free throw line. He recorded 88 blocks as well. Montverde finished the season with a 28–0 record, closing with a 71–62 victory over Oak Hill Academy in the High School National Tournament at Madison Square Garden. Simmons had 24 points and 12 rebounds as he earned MVP honours. Following the season, he was named America's top high school junior and was voted MVP at the National Basketball Players' Association Top 100 camp. On 12 November 2014, Simmons signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for Louisiana State University (LSU). On 28 January 2015, Simmons was named as a starter for the East team to compete in the 38th annual McDonald's All-American Game. On 10 March 2015, he was named the Morgan Wootten Award winner, given annually to the best male McDonald's All-American player who exemplifies outstanding character, exhibits leadership, and embodies the values of being a student-athlete in the classroom and in the community. In doing so, he became just the second player from a Florida high school to win the award behind Austin Rivers in 2011. He was then named the Naismith Prep Player of the Year on 12 March and the Gatorade National Player of the Year on 24 March after leading the Eagles to a 28–1 record and a berth in the High School National Tournament for the third straight year. In 29 regular season games, he averaged 28.0 points, 11.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.6 steals per game while shooting 70.7 percent from the field and recording 24 double-doubles. After competing in the 2015 McDonald's All-American Game on 1 April, Simmons led Montverde Academy to a third consecutive High School National Tournament title with a 70–61 win over Oak Hill Academy on 4 April at Madison Square Garden. He again earned MVP honours after recording 58 points and 35 rebounds over the three-day tournament. He then competed in the 2015 Nike Hoop Summit for the World Team on 11 April and scored 13 points in a 103–101 win over Team USA. Considered a five-star recruit by ESPN.com, Simmons was listed as the No. 1 power forward and the No. 1 player in the nation in 2015. Entering his freshman year of college, Simmons began his career on a four-stop national tour in Australia with the LSU Tigers men's basketball team. Relishing the opportunity to show his teammates where it all began for him, Simmons made his debut for LSU on 15 August in an 89–75 win over the Newcastle All-Stars in the first game of LSU's preseason Australia trip. His double-double of 22 points and 10 rebounds led the way for the Tigers, playing at the Newcastle Basketball Stadium where his father played professionally for the Newcastle Falcons in the late 1990s. The Tigers completed their five-game Australian tour with a 3–2 record, and over the five games, Simmons averaged 20 points and nine rebounds per game to lead the team in all major statistical categories. Upon returning to the United States, Simmons was featured on the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook 35th anniversary cover, was named the SEC's Preseason Player of the Year, and earned Associated Press preseason All-America team honours. His Preseason Player of the Year honour made him just the second freshman to earn the award, joining Kentucky's Julius Randle in 2013, and his All-America team honour made him just the fourth freshman to be honoured on the preseason team. On 13 November 2015, Simmons made his college debut in LSU's season opener, recording a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds as a starter in a win over McNeese State. He helped LSU start the season 3–0 before recording 21 points, 20 rebounds, 7 assists and 2 steals in a loss to Marquette on 23 November. On 2 December, he helped LSU break a three-game losing streak by recording 43 points, 14 rebounds, 7 assists, 5 steals and 3 blocks in a 119–108 win over North Florida. His 43 points were the most for a Tigers player since Shaquille O'Neal had 43 against Northern Arizona on 28 December 1991. After recording 14 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Kentucky on 5 January 2016, Simmons was dubbed the best all-round player since LeBron James by NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. On 11 February, he was named to the 35-man midseason watchlist for the Naismith Trophy. Nine days later, Simmons came off the bench for the first time after being removed from LSU's starting line-up for their game against Tennessee due to academic reasons. Following the conclusion of the regular season, Simmons was named first-team All-Southeastern Conference and the league's Freshman of the Year on the 2016 Coaches SEC voting. He was also named to the eight-player All-SEC Freshman team. The team's regular season was largely regarded as a disappointment. After ranking No. 21 in the preseason AP Top 25 vote, LSU finished the regular season with an 18–13 record, including 11–7 in SEC play. As the fourth seed in the 2016 SEC Tournament, Simmons helped LSU (18–13) defeat Tennessee in the quarter-finals to move on to the semi-finals where they faced first-seeded Texas A&M. LSU bowed out of the tournament with a demoralising 71–38 loss to the Aggies, as Simmons was unsuccessful in leading the Tigers to an NCAA tournament berth. Simmons completed the 2015–16 season having played in 33 games with 32 starts. He led the team in all major statistical categories except three-point and free throw shooting, finishing with averages of 19.2 points, 11.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 2.0 steals and 0.8 blocks in 34.9 minutes per game, while shooting 56.0% from the field, 33.3% from three-point range and 67.0% from the free throw line. In the SEC, he ranked fourth in points, first in rebounds, third in field goal percentage, fifth in assists, and second in steals. Following the announcement of the NCAA tournament field, with LSU failing to earn a bid, Tigers head coach Johnny Jones announced that the team would not play in any postseason tournament. On 21 March 2016, Simmons declared for the 2016 NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility. He withdrew from school at the conclusion of the season with plans to move immediately to Phoenix, Arizona in advance of the NBA draft. He also signed with American sports agency Klutch Sports, which is primarily owned by Rich Paul. In the week leading up to the 2016 NBA draft, Simmons' attitude and character were questioned by a number of NBA media analysts. Philadelphia 76ers head coach Brett Brown, former Australian national team coach and a friend of the Simmons family, repudiated the claims being made and was content with Simmons' pre-draft behaviour. On 23 June, he was selected by Brown and the 76ers with the number one overall pick in the 2016 draft, becoming the third Melbourne-born number one overall pick in 11 years (Andrew Bogut in 2005 and Kyrie Irving in 2011). He was also the first college player in the modern era to be selected with the first overall pick despite never playing in the NCAA Tournament. On 3 July 2016, Simmons signed his rookie scale contract with the 76ers and joined the team for the 2016 NBA Summer League. While he shot the ball poorly during his first three Summer League games, Simmons was praised for his court awareness and passing ability for a big man. He went on to be named in the All-Las Vegas Summer League First Team, and in six Summer League games, he averaged 10.8 points, 7.7 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game. On 30 September 2016, Simmons rolled his right ankle during the 76ers' final training camp scrimmage. After receiving an X-ray and MRI of the foot and ankle, it was determined that Simmons had suffered a fracture of the fifth metatarsal bone of his right foot, and was estimated to miss three to four months. However, on 24 February 2017, he was ruled out for the entire 2016–17 season after tests revealed that his broken right foot had not fully healed. Some pundits doubted his strength, fitness and scoring prowess after a full season on the sidelines, with only an outside chance for rookie of the year. In his NBA debut on 18 October 2017, Simmons had 18 points and 10 rebounds in a 120–115 season-opening loss to the Washington Wizards. In his third game, on 21 October, Simmons recorded 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in a 128–94 loss to the Toronto Raptors, joining Oscar Robertson as the only players ever to post 10+ points, 10+ rebounds and 5+ assists in their first three NBA games. In his fourth game, on 23 October, Simmons recorded his first career triple-double with 21 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a 97–86 win over the Detroit Pistons, becoming the third rookie after Robertson (1960) and Art Williams (1967) to record a triple-double in his first four games. He went on to become the only player in NBA history to begin a season with at least 170 points, 100 rebounds and 80 assists in his team's first 10 games. On 29 November, he had 31 points and a career-high 18 rebounds in a 118–113 win over the Wizards.

On 15 March against the New York Knicks, Simmons recorded his second consecutive triple-double and joined Robertson and Magic Johnson as the third rookie in NBA history to reach 1,000 points, 500 rebounds and 500 assists. His triple-double against the Knicks was his eighth of the season, thus entering second place for most triple-doubles in a rookie season, trailing only Robertson (26). On 19 March against the Charlotte Hornets, Simmons recorded 11 points, 12 rebounds and 15 assists, and became the third rookie to have 0 turnovers in a triple-double game. On 24 March, he recorded his 10th triple-double of the season with 15 points, 12 rebounds and 13 assists in a 120–108 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.

The 76ers finished the regular season with a 16th straight win to earn the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Their record of 52–30 set the best team mark since 2001, when they went 56–26. At the conclusion of the regular season, Simmons was named the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for games played in March and April, earning the award for the third consecutive month and the fourth time overall. In his playoff debut, in Game 1 of the 76ers' first-round playoff series against the Miami Heat, Simmons had 17 points, 14 assists and nine rebounds in a 130–103 win.

Snell played college basketball for the New Mexico Lobos before declaring for the NBA draft after his junior year. He was drafted with the 20th overall pick in 2013 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls.Born in Watts, California, Snell moved to Phoenix, Arizona before his senior year to finish high school at Westwind Preparatory Academy. Snell was the starting shooting guard for New Mexico in his sophomore and junior seasons, helping lead the Lobos to back-to-back Mountain West Conference (MWC) regular season and conference tournament championships as well as NCAA Tournament bids. Snell attended Martin Luther King High School in 2008–09, where he and teammate Kawhi Leonard,now with the Los Angeles Clippers, led the Wolves to a 30-3 season and a #7 national ranking in the MaxPreps/National Guard computer rankings.Snell averaged 14 points, seven rebounds, four blocks, and three assists per game under head coach Tim Sweeney. In 2009 Snell enrolled at Westwind Preparatory Academy in Phoenix, where he averaged 19.5 points, 10 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 2.7 steals, and 1.8 blocks.At Westwind he was a teammate of Jamaal Franklin, who went on to play for San Diego State University and was drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies in 2013. In 2009, ESPN scouting reports called Snell ""one of the top sleepers on the West Coast"" and a ""diamond in the rough.""Snell committed to play for the New Mexico Lobos on September 15, 2009 and signed in November 2009.The 2010-11 Lobo squad was young and inexperienced, led by lone senior Dairese Gary and UCLA transfer Drew Gordon.Snell was one of four freshmen playing significant minutes, along with Kendall Williams, Alex Kirk, and Cameron Bairstow, one of the most accomplished recruiting classes in Lobo history. The team had a roller-coaster season, starting 10-1 and later winning four straight twice, but also losing four straight and six of nine. They beat #3 BYU in Provo late in the season, but lost to the Cougars in the MWC tournament. The Lobos received a bid to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament and beat UTEP before losing at Alabama to finish the season 22-13. Snell played in all but one game, averaging 4.4 points and two rebounds. He scored in double-figures four times and led the team in scoring twice. He had a breakout performance with 16 points against then-#9 BYU, hitting four three-pointers, followed two games later by a season-best 19, with five threes, against Wyoming. He started seven games, averaging 8.3 points in his starts, and in one seven-game stretch he averaged 10.3 points a game and shot 17-31 (.548) from three. A sprained ankle late in the season limited his play and cut his production, as he managed just 11 points in the last eight games of the season. The Lobos in 2011-12 were anchored by the dominant inside play of Gordon, who tallied 19 double-doubles and whose 11.1 rebounds per game were fourth in the nation. The team allowed just 59.3 points per game, the lowest ever for the Lobos in the shot clock era, and they held opponents under 40% shooting for the first time since the 1964-65 season. Their scoring defense was fourteenth nationally, and their defensive field goal percentage was seventh. Snell was among several young guards battling for playing time going into the season, as senior and three-year starter Phillip McDonald was hampered by injury. Snell earned a starting spot after ""tearing it up in practice"" and playing well in preseason exhibition games. He was capable of explosive scoring, but he was also prone to becoming tentative and falling into slumps. He scored in double-figures in twenty games, including three games over 20, twice scoring 24, hitting six threes in one of those games; yet he also scored six or fewer points in eleven games, going scoreless for two straight games at one point. For the season, Snell averaged 10.5 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 2.3 assists a game. The Lobos won thirteen straight early in the season on the way to a 15-2 record. They lost their next two games to #16 San Diego State and at #14 UNLV but then won seven straight, avenging those losses and climbing into the top twenty with a 22-4 record. After two upset losses they settled for a share of the MWC regular season championship. In the conference tournament semi-finals, the Lobos won at #20 UNLV, with Snell accounting for 15 points, six rebounds, and six assists. The Lobos won the championship game over #18 San Diego State, as Snell scored 14, shooting 4-6 from three, and was named to the All-Tournament team. New Mexico received a five-seed in the NCAA Tournament, but Snell was a non-factor, shooting a combined 1-9 (1-8 from three) and scoring just three points as the Lobos beat Long Beach State then lost to Final Four-bound Louisville. The Lobos finished the season 28-7, and Snell was named Honorable Mention All-Mountain West. The 2012-13 Lobos again relied on tough defense and a balanced scoring attack, often coming from behind to grind out close wins. The team held opponents to sixty points a game and again held them under 40% shooting, while going 10-2 in games decided by six or fewer points. While Williams led the team at just 13.3 points a game, four players averaged in double-figures, and seven Lobo players led the team in scoring in individual games. Snell led the team in ten games, including five straight during a late stretch when he averaged 19.8 a game and shot 22-39 (.564) from three-point range. On the season, Snell averaged 12.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 2.9 assists a game, and he led the team in three-point shooting percentage and, for the second straight season, free throw percentage. Over his career, he was the fifth most accurate free throw shooter in Lobo history. The Lobos began the season 12-0, including a win over #19 Connecticut, and climbed to #16 in the polls. They lost a couple of games to eventual NCAA tournament teams South Dakota State and St. Louis, but also won at #8 Cincinnati. After a bad loss at #20 San Diego State, they won nine out of ten and clinched the MWC regular season title, while reaching #11. Snell assumed more of a leadership role, an adjustment due to his quiet demeanor — his mother termed him the ""silent assassin,"" a nickname that Lobo fans embraced. He scored 20 points or more in six games, 25 or more in three games, but he continued to struggle at times, scoring under ten points in 13 games, with a low of five. In the MWC tournament, Snell averaged 17.7 points a game while shooting 12-20 (.600) from three-point range. In the semi-final game against San Diego State, he made three three-pointers in 55 seconds as the Lobos built a large lead. In the championship game at UNLV, he shot 8-11 from the field, 5-7 from three, at one point scoring 13 straight points for the Lobos as they pulled away to seal their second straight tourney title. Snell was named tournament MVP and ESPN national player of the week for his performance. After the season, he was named Third Team All-MWC.New Mexico entered the NCAA Tournament ranked #10 and received a three-seed. They suffered a disappointing upset to Harvard, however, to finish the season 29-6. The Lobos shot poorly, with Snell going 4-12, 1-6 from three, for just nine points. Snell chose to forgo his senior season and declared for the NBA draft. While his college numbers were not spectacular, NBA scouts noted that the Lobo's balanced offense limited his output, and they were impressed by his length, outside shooting, and greatly improved defense. Snell was selected with the 20th overall pick in 2013 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls.On July 10, 2013, he signed with the Bulls and joined them for 2013 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 11.8 points, 6.6 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.2 steals in five games. As a rookie in 2013–14, Snell appeared in 77 games for the Bulls, averaging 4.5 points and 1.6 rebounds per game. In July 2014, Snell re-joined the Bulls for the 2014 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 20.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.8 assists in five games, earning All-NBA Summer League first team honors. He was reunited with former Lobo teammates Bairstow (2014 Bulls' draftee) and Williams on the Bulls' summer league squad. On February 10, 2015, he scored a career-high 24 points in the Bulls' 104–86 win over the Sacramento Kings. Snell became the Bulls' starting small forward to begin the 2015–16 season. Over the first 25 games of the season, Snell started in all but four. However, on December 21, he was removed from the team's regular rotation and over the next three games, he was credited with a ""DNP"" in two of the three. With teammate Doug McDermott out injured on December 28 against the Toronto Raptors, Snell got his chance to re-establish himself in the rotation, coming off the bench to score an equal team-high 22 points on 8-of-14 shooting in 27 minutes of action, helping the Bulls defeat the Raptors 104–97. On October 17, 2016, Snell was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Michael Carter-Williams. After missing the Bucks' season opener with a sprained left ankle, Snell made his debut for the team in their second game of the season on October 29, 2016, scoring six points in 21 minutes as a starter in a 110–108 win over the Brooklyn Nets. On December 26, 2016, he made a career-high six three-pointers and set a season high with 20 points in a 107–102 loss to the Washington Wizards. On March 6, 2017, he had 18 of his season-high 21 in the first half of the Bucks' 112–98 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. He surpassed that mark on March 28 with a career-high 26 points in a 118–108 win over the Charlotte Hornets. On April 22, 2017, he set playoff career highs with 19 points and five 3-pointers in an 87–76 loss to the Toronto Raptors in Game 4 of their first-round playoff series; the loss tied the series at 2–2. On July 31, 2017, Snell re-signed with the Bucks to a four-year, $44 million contract. The deal reportedly includes a player option after the third year and reachable incentives that would push his total earnings to $46 million. On March 23, 2018, he matched his season high with 18 points in a 118–105 win over the Chicago Bulls. On June 20, 2019, Snell was traded, along with the draft rights to Kevin Porter Jr., to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Jon Leuer.",26586,3997,2019-20,51.0,49.0,1395.0,3.9,8.6,0.455,2.4,5.8,0.413,1.5,2.8,0.541,0.6,0.6,1.0,0.2,2.1,2.3,2.5,0.6,0.3,0.6,2.1,10.7,9.0,Detroit Pistons

He played college basketball for the Purdue Boilermakers. He was ranked among the top prep players in the national class of 2015 by Rivals.com, Scout.com and ESPN. He completed his senior season in the 2014–15 academic year for Homestead High School, who went on to win the first state championship in the school's history. Swanigan was named Indiana's Mr. Basketball and a McDonald's All-American. Swanigan originally committed to Michigan State University, but later decommitted and committed to Purdue University. He was named Big Ten Freshman of the Week three times, a record at Purdue. He was also named to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team and also received a National Freshman of the Week award. Swanigan finished the season with 10.2 points per game and 8.3 rebounds per game. During his sophomore year, Swanigan was named the Big Ten Player of the Year and first-team All-Big Ten, and was a unanimous first-team All-American. He was a finalist for the 2017 Karl Malone Award, given to the nation's top power forward. On June 22, 2017, he was selected 26th overall in the first round of the 2017 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers.Caleb Swanigan, born April 18, 1997, grew up in an unstable home due to his father, Carl Swanigan Sr., who had a crack cocaine addiction. Swanigan's mother, Tanya, had six children. Swanigan moved between Utah and Indianapolis, Indiana during his youth, spending time in homeless shelters.Swanigan inherited two key features from his biological father—height and a tendency to obesity. The elder Swanigan, who died in 2014 from complications from diabetes, was 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) and weighed nearly 500 pounds (230 kg) at his death. By the time Swanigan was entering eighth grade, he was 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) and 360 pounds (160 kg).Swanigan has described his bad eating habits as primarily eating desserts and being surrounded by unhealthy food due to his family's financial situation. Swanigan's large size was the reason his aunt nicknamed him ""Biggie,"" often saying ""Biggie Biggie Biggie, can't you see.""His weight issues, according to ESPN writer Myron Medcalf, were also a symptom of his unstable home situation. His father had many brushes with the law, battled drug addiction for most of his adult life, and physically assaulted his wife. According to a story in Bleacher Report, he was accidentally dropped by his mother as an infant, leaving a bruise on his face; this incident led her to move with her children to Salt Lake City. For the next decade, the family bounced between Indianapolis and Utah; he recalled that he lived in five different homeless shelters and attended 13 different schools by the time he was 13.When his mother decided to move the family to Houston, his older brother Carl Jr., concerned that Caleb would keep gaining weight if he moved with his mother, called his former AAU basketball coach, Roosevelt Barnes, a former three-sport star at Purdue who played on the school's 1980 Final Four team and now a successful sports agent. Barnes, living in Fort Wayne, Indiana, agreed to take Caleb in if he could adopt him and raise him as his own son. Barnes adopted Swanigan prior to his 8th grade year. Barnes addressed Swanigan's eating habits and, after receiving clearance from a cardiologist, began putting him through workouts similar to those Barnes himself went through in college. By the time Swanigan finished high school, he had slimmed down to 260 pounds (120 kg).In the fall of 2011, Swanigan attended a basketball camp led by NBA former coach John Lucas after Barnes convinced Lucas to let him into the invite-only camp in Louisville.When it came to selecting his high school, Swanigan's guardian Barnes said, ""When he chose his high school, his high school had never really done much in the tournament, and his goal was to win a state championship at a school where that had never been done before.""Swanigan attended Homestead High School and wore the same number as Barnes, number 44.As a senior, he was named Indiana Mr. Basketball and led Homestead to a first-ever state title. He was ranked as a top-20 national prospect in his class.He was named a McDonald's All-American.Swanigan averaged 22.6 points and 13.7 rebounds as a senior.Academically, Swanigan maintained a 3.1 GPA and graduated in three years instead of the usual four.Swanigan had several teams recruit him and offer scholarships; Arizona, Kentucky, Cal, and Duke were among the schools that gave Swanigan an offer. Caleb Swanigan verbally committed to Michigan State on April 10, 2015, but decommitted on May 7. He said, ""I just felt like it was better basketball-wise for me.""Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, ""He wants to win a national championship and said he wants to do it in the state of Indiana and wanted to do it at a place he's never done it before.""Some people believe Barnes had ulterior motives in adopting Swanigan, to which Barnes said, ""Maybe if I wanted to develop the next hot-dog-eating champion, the next Joey Chestnut, people would have a legitimate gripe."" Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot.He decided to stay in-state and chose Purdue on May 19. Swanigan announced his decision by tweeting ""#BoilerUp"". Swanigan was Purdue's first Indiana's Mr. Basketball recruit since Glenn Robinson in 1991, and was the first McDonald's All-American for Purdue since 1996.Swanigan joined Ryan Cline and Grant Weatherford in Purdue's 2015 recruiting class.Swanigan chose to major in general education/educational studies.

However, despite being one of 63 invitees for the NBA Draft Combine that year, he ultimately decided to return to college on May 25, which was also the new date set for players to withdraw their names from the draft and try again for another year. An NBA scout said, ""I think he has a chance if he can improve his jump shot and help defense. Big-time rebounder, works hard on his own. He's still more undersized center than power forward, though.""Similar to his freshman year, Swanigan started every game as a sophomore.

He has also been named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. Thompson is the son of former NBA player Mychal Thompson. He played college basketball for three seasons with the Washington State Cougars, where he was a two-time first-team all-conference selection in the Pac-10. He was selected in the first round of the 2011 NBA draft by Golden State with the 11th overall pick. In 2014, Thompson and teammate Stephen Curry set a then-NBA record with 484 combined three-pointers in a season,earning the pair the nickname the ""Splash Brothers"".In 2015, Thompson helped lead the Warriors to their first NBA Championship since 1975, and was a key contributor in the Warriors' 2017 and 2018 titles. Thompson was born in Los Angeles to Julie and Mychal Thompson. His mother was a volleyball player in college for the University of Portland and University of San Francisco, while his father was the first overall pick of the 1978 NBA draft.When Thompson was two, he and his family moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he was childhood friends and Little League teammates with fellow future NBA star Kevin Love.At age 14, the Thompsons moved to Ladera Ranch, California, where Klay graduated from Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita in 2008.In his junior season he was named to the All-Area second team and to the Orange County third team.

Thompson declared for the 2011 NBA draft after his junior season, being selected 11th overall by the Golden State Warriors. This pick of a guard prompted speculation that the Warriors would trade starter Monta Ellis. Warriors general manager Larry Riley praised Thompson for his shooting ability and expressed confidence that Thompson would improve his defensive skills with new coach Mark Jackson. The NBA did not select Thompson for the 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend Rising Stars Challenge. However, in the four games after that decision, Thompson improved in all areas of basketball over his current season averages: points per game (12.5 over 7.6), shooting percentage (54.3% overall including 55.6% for three-pointers, up from 46.7 and 48.1), rebounds (2.8 from 1.6), assists (1.5 from 1.3), steals, and turnovers. The Warriors traded Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks on March 13, 2012. The following game, Thompson scored a season-high 26 points in a loss to the Boston Celtics. A week later, he exceeded his previous high with 27 points in a win over the New Orleans Hornets.

Thompson had an NBA season-high and career-best performance for the highest-scoring output by a Golden State player in more than 42 years. His 40 first-half points tied him for second-most scored in a half over the past decade. In addition, Thompson became the first Warrior to score 60 points since Hall of Famer Rick Barry's 64 on March 26, 1974, joining Naismith honorees Wilt Chamberlain and Joe Fulks as the only Golden State players to do so. On January 26, he was named a Western Conference All-Star reserve for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. He participated in the Three-Point Contest, but he failed to defend his title as he was eliminated in the first round. On April 4, 2017, he scored 41 points (his 10th career 40-point game) in a 121–107 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Warriors finished the season as the first seed in the West with a 67–15 record. Thompson struggled with his shooting for extended stretches during the playoffs, but his defense against opposing guards like Damian Lillard, Patty Mills, and Kyrie Irving stood out. Following a 129–115 victory in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals over the San Antonio Spurs, the Warriors reached their third straight NBA Finals series, becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12–0. Thompson helped the Warriors win their second championship in three years with a 4–1 series win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2017 NBA Finals.

He did not make multiple three-pointers in any of the contests, a career-worst seven-game drought for him. On October 29, 2018, against the Chicago Bulls, he hit an NBA-record 14 threes to break Curry's former mark of 13. Thompson scored 52 points in 27 minutes while making 14-for-24 of his threes and shooting 18-for-29 overall from the field.

On November 24, he scored 31 points with five 3-pointers in a 117–116 win over the Sacramento Kings. Thompson moved into 21st place on the NBA's career 3-pointers list when he hit his 1,609th in the first quarter, moving past Jason Richardson. On December 29, he had his second-highest scoring game of the season with 32 points in a 115–105 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

On March 13, he scored 30 points in a 106–104 win over the Houston Rockets. He made five 3-pointers to give him 203 for the season, joining Curry as the only players in NBA history to have seven straight seasons with 200 3-pointers. Praised for his defense throughout his career, Thompson was named to the NBA All-Defensive Team for the first time, earning second team honors. For Game 3 of the 2019 NBA Finals against the Toronto Raptors, Thompson missed his first career playoff game after straining his left hamstring late in Game 2. He returned in Game 4 and scored 28 points with six 3-pointers in a 105–92 loss, as the Warriors went down 3–1 in the series.

He finished the playoffs in third for career postseason 3-pointers (374), trailing only Curry (470) and Ray Allen (385). On July 1, 2019, Thompson agreed to stay with the Warriors on a five-year, $190 million maximum contract with an additional fifteen-percent trade kicker as a result of not making an All-NBA Team, which could have made him eligible for a supermax deal like Curry was in 2017. The next day, on July 2, 2019, Thompson underwent successful knee surgery on his torn ACL. Thompson officially re-signed on July 10. Thompson was a member of the United States national team that won the gold medal at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics. He also won gold as a member of the Under-19 national team at the 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Championship. Thompson is both a prolific and efficient shooter, particularly from range, as well as an elite free-throw shooter. He relies upon a shooting form that has been described as ""textbook"" and ""picture-perfect"". Though he is capable of handling the ball in the Warriors offense, Thompson is primarily a catch-and-shoot player, taking advantage of back-cuts and screens set by teammates to make space for his exceptionally accurate quick-release shot. Although Thompson is not known for blocking shots or creating steals, he is considered a strong defender thanks to his size at the guard position and ability to defend against both elite guards and wings. He is also praised for his stamina. Thompson is also known for his quiet, laid-back personality, rarely showing emotion in or out of games. He is one of the few players in the NBA sponsored by Chinese shoe company Anta, signing a 10-year deal with it in 2016. Thompson's older brother, Mychel, played basketball for Pepperdine University and had a brief stint in the NBA with Cleveland, while his younger brother, Trayce, became a Major League Baseball player. Thompson faced controversy when he was suspended for his final regular season game at WSU after being issued a misdemeanor criminal citation for marijuana possession. After winning the NBA championship in 2015, Thompson and his father became the fourth father-son duo to win an NBA title, joining Matt Guokas Sr. and Jr., Rick and Brent Barry, and Bill and Luke Walton. Thompson is known for his offbeat, dry sense of humor. He owns an English bulldog named Rocco. In late October 2017, Thompson participated in local efforts to raise money for relief for the October 2017 Northern California wildfires, donating $1,000 for every point he scored in home games against the Washington Wizards, Toronto Raptors, and Detroit Pistons. With additional sponsor and fan matching Thompson was able to increase that to $5,223 per point, ultimately raising $360,374 by tallying 69 points across the three games. Thompson is an avid chess player and has met with the chess world champion, Magnus Carlsen.",26006,4223,2018-19,78.0,78.0,2652.0,8.9,19.0,0.467,3.3,8.1,0.402,5.6,10.9,0.516,1.8,2.1,0.816,0.5,3.6,4.1,2.5,1.1,0.6,1.6,2.1,22.8,10.0,Golden State Warriors

He played one season of college basketball for Texas before being drafted fourth overall by the Cavaliers in the 2011 NBA draft.He also represents Canada in international competition. Thompson won an NBA championship with the Cavaliers in 2016. Born in Brampton, Thompson attended St. Marguerite d'Youville Secondary School in Brampton for his freshman year. After driving from Brampton twice to visit a prep school in the United States, Thompson decided to attend Saint Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey for his sophomore year along with fellow University of Texas at Austin commit Myck Kabongo. He cited the increase in exposure and skill level as his reason for transferring.Thompson spent his sophomore and half his junior year at St. Benedict's, making an immediate impact and showing flashes of brilliance.In his short time there, he shot through the ranks to super-stardom, becoming the top recruit in the nation entering his junior season.The nation's top basketball programs heavily sought Thompson, who made the first verbal commitment of the class of 2010 to Rick Barnes and the Texas Longhorns.Twenty-one games into his junior year, the relationship between Thompson and then-St. Benedict's coach Dan Hurley hit a rough patch. Hurley's in-your-face, no-holds-barred coaching style took a toll on the young star. During a game against then-top-ranked Mater Dei, Hurley confronted Thompson during a time out. A heated debate ensued, and Thompson was sent off the court and later removed from the team.Over the next few days he made it known that he was planning to leave, resulting in a barrage of calls from top prep schools throughout North America trying to acquire his services. The next week he transferred to Findlay Prep with his close friend and AAU teammate Cory Joseph.Thompson joined Findlay on the back end of their schedule, making an immediate impact on the team and thriving under Findlay coach Michael Peck's system and coaching style. Thompson solidified his top recruit status and helped lead Findlay to their first National Championship. He continued to round and polish his skills his senior year in preparation for college and held fast to his commitment to the University of Texas, officially signing his letter of intent on November 11, 2009. Thompson then led his team to another National Championship at the ESPN National High School Invitational. After their senior year, Thompson and Joseph both committed to Texas and were the fourth and fifth Canadians to be named McDonald's All-Americans, after Bill Wennington (1981), Barry Bekkedam (1986) and Olu Famutimi (2003). Thompson was also named a Jordan Brand Classic All-American. Thompson averaged 13.1 points and 7.8 rebounds per game for the Texas Longhorns in 2010–11 as he won the team's Most Valuable Player award, as voted on by his teammates. Nationally, Thompson was one of five finalists for the Wayman Tisdale Award, an honor given to the National Freshman of the Year by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association. Thompson won the Big 12 Freshman of the Year honours as well as first-team NABC All-District 8 and USBWA All-District VII honours. He led the team in rebounding, blocked shots (86), double-doubles (10) and field goal percentage (.546) while ranking second in scoring. He helped Texas conclude the 2010–11 season with a 28–8 record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament Round of 32. The Longhorns finished No. 8 in the final AP poll. Thompson told media after the NCAA tournament that he planned to return to Texas for his sophomore season but changed his mind. On April 21, 2011, he declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his three years of college eligibility. On June 23, 2011, Thompson was drafted fourth overall in the 2011 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. At the time, he was the highest drafted Canadian-born player in NBA history, that was until Anthony Bennett and Andrew Wiggins were selected with the first overall pick in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Thompson continued to make history, drafted alongside Joseph, who was picked 29th by the San Antonio Spurs, one of only two occasions in NBA history that two Canadians were selected in the first round of the same draft, the other being in 1983 when Leo Rautins and Stewart Granger were selected 17th and 25th respectively. The 2011 draft was also the first time three Texas Longhorn basketball players went in the first round of a draft, when Thompson's former collegiate teammate Jordan Hamilton went 26th overall to the Dallas Mavericks. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Thompson attended classes at the University of Texas to finish his college degree. Thompson signed his rookie contract with the Cavaliers on December 9, 2011 before the start of training camp. Thompson made his professional debut against his hometown Toronto Raptors on December 26, 2011. In 17 minutes off the bench, Thompson scored 12 points and pulled in 5 rebounds. Thompson came off the bench behind veteran forwards Antawn Jamison and Anderson Varejão for the first three months of his rookie season but still managed to make his presence known on both ends of the court. His production increased in February as his minutes increased, and he recorded three double-doubles that month. His best performance in February was a 15-point, 12-rebound, two-block effort in 30 minutes of play as the Cavaliers defeated Sacramento 93–92. Both Thompson and teammate Kyrie Irving were later named to the 2012 Rising Stars Challenge. However, Thompson was selected to play for Team Shaq, while Irving was selected by Team Chuck. Thompson was inserted into the starting lineup on March 18 against Atlanta as Varejao continued to recover from a fractured wrist. He recorded seven points and six rebounds. The turning point of his season came in the following game against New Jersey, when he posted a 27-point, 12-rebound performance in a 105–100 road win. After Varejao was ruled out indefinitely, head coach Byron Scott decided to start Thompson at centre for the remainder of the regular season. Thompson did not disappoint, upping his averages to 9.3 points, 7.5 rebounds and just under one block per game as a starter. He shone in April even with Cleveland out of the playoff race, scoring in double figures in 10 of his final 16 games and blocking a season-high four shots against Memphis on April 23. He finished the season with averages of 8.2 points and 6.5 rebounds in 60 games as he earned NBA All-Rookie second team honours, becoming the first Canadian to ever earn All-Rookie team honours in the NBA. In the 2012–13 season, Thompson worked on avoiding getting his own shots blocked, and switched his shooting hand from left to right. For most of the season, almost 17%, or one out of six, of his shots were blocked, threatening former NBA player Danny Fortson's 16.7% rate in 1997–98. Thompson dropped to around 15% by season's end, which was only reached by three other players before the season.[b] He went on to average 3.7 offensive rebounds per game, which ranked fifth in the NBA and first among second year players, and set the Cavaliers franchise record for most offensive rebounds in a single season with 306 (second in the NBA), surpassing Zydrunas Ilgauskas' 299 offensive rebounds in the 2004–05 season. He also recorded a team-high 31 double-doubles on the season, becoming just the ninth player in franchise history to total at least 30 double-doubles in a single season. He started all 82 games in 2012–13 as he averaged 11.7 points on .488 shooting, 9.4 rebounds and 0.9 blocks in 31.3 minutes per game. In the 2013 off-season, Thompson decided to switch his shooting hand to his right instead of his left. Despite the change, he had an almost identical season for the Cavaliers in 2013–14, as he started all 82 games while averaging 11.7 points and 9.2 rebounds in 31.6 minutes per game.

When the Pacers benched their entire starting lineup on April 6, he scored 23 to help the team to a win over the Milwaukee Bucks. Turner was reported to have an acrimonious relationship with Indiana teammate Lance Stephenson because both were ""free agents to be...looking for their first big contract"" who played the same style and they were both trying to fill the role of ""next big thing"". The conflict led to a fist fight between the two on April 21, 2014, in a team practice on the eve of the team's second game of the first round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs. Stephenson has a reputation for irritating people however. Less than a month earlier, Turner had come to the rescue when Stephenson had derailed against Dwyane Wade. In game 6 of the first round series against Atlanta with Indiana trailing 3–2, head coach Frank Vogel changed the rotation and Turner was left out, playing no minutes, while some of his playing time went to Rasual Butler.

Vučević's mother, Ljiljana Kubura, an ethnic Serb was a 6-foot-2 forward for the Sarajevo club Željezničar, as well as for the Yugoslavia women's national team.His family moved to Montenegro when he was a teenager.In 2007, fifteen-year-old Vučević was named Montenegro's Best Young Player.He speaks Serbian, English and French.Vučević moved to Simi Valley, California in the United States in October 2007 to play his senior year of high school at Stoneridge Prep.He knew little English, but did speak French, which many of his teammates also spoke. Under coach Babacar Sy, a friend of his father's, he was team captain and led the team in scoring and rebounding with 18 points and 12 rebounds.Vučević played three seasons with the Trojans of the University of Southern California. Vučević missed the first eight games of the season while waiting to have his amateur status confirmed by the NCAA Clearinghouse. He averaged 2.6 points and 2.7 rebounds in 23 games in three starts. Vučević played in his first game with USC on 15 December 2008, against Pepperdine, and had two points, two blocks, and two rebounds in six minutes. He made his first start of the season on 24 January 2009, at Washington State in the Trojans' 46–44 win with a season-high eight points and five rebounds. He also scored eight points on 9 February 2009 at UCLA, and in his second start of the season on 19 February against Washington State. Vučević had a season-best seven rebounds in that game and matched that total on 5 March 2009, vs. Oregon. Vučević scored six points and had four rebounds in the NCAA second-round loss to Michigan State on 22 March. In all, he made 57.8 percent of his shots from the field (26-for-45). Vučević began to excel in his sophomore season. He scored 18 points and had eight rebounds in the first game of the season against UC Riverside on 17 November 2009, both totals better than any of his freshman games. Vučević had 18 points and 14 rebounds at Texas on 3 December 2009. He scored a career-high 19 points and had 11 rebounds vs. Loyola Marymount on 21 November 2009, for his first career double-double. He matched his career high with 19 points on 9-of-12 shooting at UCLA on 16 January 2010, scoring 17 points in the second half. By the end of the year, he had led USC in scoring five times and in rebounding 20 times, including the last nine games. Overall, he was the second-best scorer and leading rebounder on the Trojans, with 10.7 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Vučević led the Pac-10 with 283 rebounds and offensive rebounds per game (6.3) and his 39 blocks were the fourth most in the conference. Vučević's .504 shooting percentage (126-for-250) led USC and was seventh best in the Pac-10. Vučević was named the 2009–10 Pac-10 Most Improved Player, and earned all-Pac-10 second team and Pac-10 honorable-mention all-defensive team honors.He had the second-most blocks ever in a season by a Trojan sophomore and the third-most rebounds. Vučević started all 30 games for USC and posted 10 double-doubles. As a junior, Vucevic was picked to the Fourth Team All-America by Fox Sportsand was named to the All-Pac-10 first team. In March 2011, Vučević announced that he would give up his senior year to enter the NBA draft. The website NBAdraft.net projected him as the 23rd pick in the draft.During his stint with the Trojans, Vučević averaged 11.1 points and 8.0 rebounds per game. On 23 June 2011, Vučević was drafted with the 16th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Vučević played for Montenegrin team Budućnost Podgorica. Following the conclusion of the lockout, he returned to the United States and signed his rookie scale contract with the 76ers on 9 December 2011. On 22 February 2012, Vučević scored a season-high 18 points in a loss to the Houston Rockets. On 10 August 2012, Vučević was traded to the Orlando Magic in a four-team trade involving Dwight Howard, Andrew Bynum, Arron Afflalo, Andre Iguodala, and other players. On 31 December 2012, in an overtime loss to the Miami Heat, Vučević set a franchise record with 29 rebounds. On 10 April 2013, he recorded his second straight 20/20 game with a career-high 30 points and 20 rebounds in a 113–103 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On 6 November 2013, Vučević recorded a career-high tying 30 points and 21 rebounds in a 98–90 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Vučević's strong play over the second half of the 2013–14 season was noticeable on 28 March 2014 when he dominated the Charlotte Bobcats. He overcame a slow start shooting the ball to finish the game with 24 points and 23 rebounds in an overtime victory. Vučević made nine of his last 11 shots to lead a Magic rally in the second half, while also grabbing 16 first-half rebounds and 10 offensive boards in the game, marking the sixth 20-point, 20-rebound game of his career. On 23 October 2014, Vučević signed a four-year, $53 million contract extension with the Magic. On 3 April 2015, he scored a career-high 37 points in a 97–84 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. On 11 November 2015, Vučević didn't start for the Magic against the Los Angeles Lakers, returning to action after a three-game absence with a right knee contusion. Vučević, who had started all 223 games for the Magic over his four-season tenure, came off the bench for the first time and scored 18 points, including a fallaway 18-footer at the buzzer to lift the Magic over the Lakers 101–99. Vučević averaged 18.4 points, 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists in his first 12 games of December (1–23 December). Shaquille O'Neal is the only other Magic player to reach those numbers in one month in franchise history. On 7 February 2016, he scored 22 points and hit an 18-footer at the buzzer to lead the Magic over the Atlanta Hawks 96–94, winning for only the third time in 18 games in 2016. On 23 February, he scored a season-high 35 points in a 124–115 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On 31 March, he returned to action after missing the previous 13 games with a right groin strain. He subsequently came off the bench for just the second in his Magic tenure, as he scored 24 points in a 114–94 win over the Indiana Pacers. He came off the bench for a further three games before returning to the starting line-up on 8 April against the Miami Heat, where he scored a game-high 29 points in a 112–109 win. Vučević started in all 16 games for the Magic to start the 2016–17 season, coming off the bench for just the sixth time in his Magic tenure on 27 November 2016 against the Milwaukee Bucks. Vučević continued to come off the bench throughout December, while also missing three games between 10 and 14 December with a back injury. On 20 December, he had a season-high 26 points and 12 rebounds off the bench in a 136–130 double overtime win over the Miami Heat. He regained his starting spot in mid-January, and as a result, he hit 13 of 18 shots, scored a season-high 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Magic to a 115–109 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on 13 January. On 7 February 2017, he had 14 points and a season-high 19 rebounds in a 128–104 loss to the Houston Rockets. On 11 March 2017, in a 116–104 loss to Cleveland, Vučević had a team-high 20 points and 16 rebounds after missing the previous four games with a sore right Achilles. On 10 April 2017, he grabbed 10 rebounds against Chicago to move ahead of Shaquille O'Neal into second place in franchise history, trailing only Dwight Howard. On 20 October 2017, Vučević scored a career-high 41 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in a 126–121 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. On 9 December 2017, he recorded his first career triple-double with game highs of 31 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in a 117–110 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. He became the first Magic center to record a triple-double with assists—Shaquille O'Neal and Dwight Howard each accomplished it with blocks. On 23 December 2017, he suffered a fractured left hand against the Washington Wizards and was subsequently ruled out for six to eight weeks. He returned to action on 22 February 2018 against the New York Knicks after missing 23 games, recording 19 points and six rebounds in a 120–113 loss. On 14 March 2018, he recorded 22 points, nine rebounds and nine assists in a 126–117 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. On 20 October 2018, Vučević recorded his second career triple-double with 27 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in a 116–115 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. On 17 November, he had a season-high 36 points and 13 rebounds in a 130–117 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Eight days later, he had 31 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists in a 108–104 win also against the Lakers. Prior to the second match-up against the Lakers, Lakers coach Luke Walton described Vučević as a ""nightmare to matchup  with"" because of the versatility of his offensive game. Following the 108–104 win, Lakers forward LeBron James noted that ""He's (Vučević) got our number this year. All you can say."" On 6 January, Vučević had 16 points and 24 rebounds in a 106–96 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On 31 January, he received his first All-Star selection in his eight-year career, earning Eastern Conference reserve honours. He became the Magic's first All-Star since Dwight Howard in 2012. On 17 March, he scored 17 of his 27 points in the first eight minutes of the game and added 20 rebounds in a 101–91 win over the Atlanta Hawks. Vučević helped the Magic go 22–9 over the final 31 games of the season to clinch their first playoff berth since 2012. In game one of the Magic's first-round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors, Vučević scored 11 points in a 104–101 upset victory. They went on to lose to the Raptors in five games. Vucevic entered the offseason as an unrestricted free agent. On June 30, 2019, he signed a four-year, $100 million contract to remain with the Magic. Vučević represented Montenegro Under-20 team at the FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship. He then represented the senior Montenegro national basketball team at FIBA EuroBasket 2011, FIBA EuroBasket 2013 and FIBA EuroBasket 2017. He averaged 5.0 points per game and 3.2 rebounds per game in 2011 while backing up Nikola Peković. With Peković out of the 2013 tournament, Vučević started for the team and put up 7.0 points per game and 4.0 rebounds per game. Nikola is an ethnic Serb and Serbian Christian Orthodox. Vučević's son Filip was born on 17 December 2018. Vučević is a fan of KK Crvena zvezda and FK Crvena zvezda.",26625,4388,2019-20,44.0,44.0,1415.0,8.5,18.6,0.458,1.9,5.5,0.344,6.6,13.1,0.506,2.3,3.0,0.776,2.9,9.2,12.1,4.2,1.0,1.0,1.7,2.5,21.2,22.0,Orlando Magic

24409,4398,Moritz Wagner,Victor Moritz Wagner,F-C,6-11,245.0,April 26 1997,"Berlin, Germany",False,/players/w/wagnemo01.html,30.0,"[14, 30]","Moritz Wagner (Bayreuth, 3 October 1813 – Munich, 31 May 1887) was a German explorer, collector, geographer and natural historian. Wagner devoted three years (1836–1839) to the exploration of Algiers:it was here that he made important observations in natural history, which he later supplemented and developed: that geographical isolation could play a key role in speciation. From 1852–1855, together with Carl Scherzer, Wagner travelled through North and Central America and the Caribbean. In May 1843, Wagner toured the Lake Sevan region of Armenia with Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian.He committed suicide in Munich, aged 73. His brother Rudolf was a physiologist and anatomist. Wagner's early career was as a geographer, and he published a number of geographical books about North Africa, the Middle East, and Tropical America. He was also a keen naturalist and collector, and it is for this work he is best known among biologists. Ernst Mayr, the evolutionist and historian of biology, has given an account of Wagner's significance.p562–565. However, others disagree with this account.During his three years in Algeria, he (amongst other activities) studied the flightless beetles Pimelia and Melasoma. In these genera, a number of species are each confined to a stretch of the north coast between rivers which descend from the Atlas mountains to the Mediterranean. As soon as one crosses a river, a different but closely related species appears.Wagner made similar observations in the Caucasus and in the Andean valleys, leading him to conclude, after the Origin of Species had been published:This was an early description of the process of geographic speciation by means of the founder effect. Another formulation of this idea came later: ""Organisms which never leave their ancient area of distribution will never change"".Wagner's idea met with a mixed reception. ""Unfortunately, Wagner combined [his idea] with some peculiar ideas on variation and selection"" (Mayr). The leading evolutionists (Darwin, Wallace, Weismann) attacked Wagner's idea of geographic speciation, and it suffered a long decline until in 1942 it was reintroduced by Mayr.The importance of geographic speciation became one of the core ideas of the evolutionary synthesis. Some modern experts such as Ernst Mayr, Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr, argue that Wagner pioneered the idea of geographical speciation, and that Darwin had not appreciated it. However, Wagner's ""migration theory"" was based on a rather simple, Lamarckian idea of evolution. Wagner argued in letters to Darwin that the latter had missed a vital geographic component in understanding the evolution of new species. Darwin at first responded in a friendly way to these letters, and agreed that geographic isolation was important (although not the only cause of speciation), and pointed out that he had in fact dealt with geographic speciation in The Origin of Species. Wagner in his later articles totally rejected the importance of natural selection. He again pointed out the importance of intercrossing in preventing divergence, and thus for geographic separation in allowing divergence. Wagner argued that Darwin had not understood this, although these ideas are present in The Origin of Species.Darwin found Wagner's increasingly hysterical tone and one-sided argument upsetting, and wrote across his copy of Wagner's 1875 paper ""most wretched rubbish."" As well as Darwin, the Reverend J.T. Gulick also found Wagner's theories overstated. Gulick was apparently responding to David Starr Jordan, who approved of Wagner's geographic speciation ideas in a paper which is often cited as providing early support of geographical speciation. Jordan later wrote a brief note of correction agreeing with some of Gulick's criticisms: In a later paper Gulick says that ""Moritz Wagner, in his 'Law of the Migration of Organisms,' was the first to insist on the importance of geographical isolation as a factor in evolution, but when he asserted that without geographical isolation natural selection could have no effect in producing new species he went beyond what could be sustained by facts"". Mayr's formulation has been argued to have cleared up issues which Wagner had left unresolved: ""A new species develops if a population which has become isolated from its parental species acquires during this period of isolation characters which promote or guarantee isolation when the external barriers break down"".The zoological taxonomist Bernhard Rensch was also significant in keeping geographical speciation on the evolutionary menu. He identified geographical separation as the most frequent initial step towards cladogenesis (phylogenetic branching). However, a variety of species concepts compete with Mayr's isolation concept of species today, and so Mayr's account can no longer be accepted to be the gold standard (disambiguation). The importance of Wagner's insight is highly debatable today, as it is clear that geographical isolation is not the only mechanism which causes species-splitting. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that natural selection is the most important cause of speciation, even when the geographical milieu is in isolation. There is room for debate as to whether Charles Darwin had reached a similar conclusion at the same time. The Origin of Species was published nearly twenty years after Wagner's first account, but more relevant is the evidence of his notebooks. The evidence of Darwin's notebooks (which were not published until the mid-20th century) shows a ""clear description of reproductive isolation, maintained by ethological [behavioural] isolating mechanisms""p266; the same ideas are also present in The Origin of Species, but are often not recognized as such by modern biologists.On the other hand, there is no single example in the notebooks quite so clear as Wagner's flightless beetles. Much of the good in Wagner's ideas is masked by his other, mistaken, beliefs, but his inferences about geographical speciation were important insights gained by observation of insects in their natural habitats. But again, see Sulloway's article.Speciation isn't just about geography, it is more important that it requires splitting that endures in spite of geographic overlap.

He grew up in The Bronx, New York. After graduating from Rice High School in 2008, he went on to play college basketball for the Connecticut Huskies. In their 2010–11 season, Walker was the nation's second-leading scorer in college basketball and was named consensus First Team All-American; he also led the Huskies to the 2011 NCAA championship and claimed the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player award.He is a four-time NBA All-Star. Walker attended Rice High School in Harlem, New York. During his junior year, Walker played once at Madison Square Garden against Simeon Career Academy and senior guard Derrick Rose in a 53–51 victory.Over his senior year, he posted 18.2 points and 5.3 assists per game,earning him a spot on the prestigious McDonald's All-American Team. He was able to play in the elite New York City Gauchos, the premier AAU basketball program for youth, and was joined by fellow Big East Conference talents-to-be Jordan Theodore, Darryl Bryant, Devin Hill, and Danny Jennings. Walker's team finished No. 1 in the nation. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Walker was listed as the No. 5 point guard and the No. 14 player in the nation in 2008.During his freshman year at the University of Connecticut, Walker played in every contest and was named to the Big East All-Rookie Team. He helped the Huskies achieve a number one seed in the 2009 NCAA Tournament. Despite starting in only two games, he averaged 25.5 minutes per contest, easily far more than any regular non-starter.He also helped the Huskies advance to the 2009 Final Four with a 23-point effort in the Elite Eight versus Missouri.During the Huskies' 2009-10 season, Walker started in all 34 of their games and contributed an average of 14.6 points. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth time in the last nine games of the season, with 18 points at Virginia Tech. Walker was named by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to the First Team All-District. Connecticut clinched a 4-seed in the NCAA's 2010 National Invitation Tournament only to fall short to Virginia Tech and finish the relatively disappointing season going 18–16 (7–11) in conference play.Walker rose to national prominence in his third year at Connecticut. This was because, twelve games into his junior campaign, he distinguished himself as the leading scorer in the nation, posting 26.7 points per contest; in addition, Walker averaged 5 rebounds and 3.8 assists. It was then that he appeared on one of the six regional covers of Sports Illustrated magazine. In the 2011 Big East Tournament, Walker hit the game-clinching shot at the buzzer to beat the Pittsburgh Panthers, ranked No. 3 overall, thereby advancing the Huskies to the semifinals. Walker led UConn to victory in the ensuing Big East Championship against the Louisville Cardinals and earned tournament MVP honors in the process. Over five games in as many days, Walker tallied an unprecedented 130 points, a record of points scored for not only the Big East but for any conference tournament in the past 15 seasons. UConn thus became the first school to win five games in five days and earn a conference championship. On March 14, 2011, the U.S. Basketball Writers Association named Walker First Team All-American with only Fox Sports picking him to the Second Team. His heroic performance in the 2010–11 season also made him a finalist for the Association's college player of the year honors, the Oscar Robertson Trophy. Despite finishing second to Jimmer Fredette for this award, at least several journalists held that it was rather Walker who deserved the distinction of best player that year. Among other accolades bestowed on him, Walker claimed the Bob Cousy Award for college basketball's top point guard in the nation. On April 4 of 2011, Walker, with 16 points himself, rallied and led the University of Connecticut to win the Division I Championship, while he won the honor of NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player. Upon the team's return from Houston, at a pep rally to celebrate the National Title, Walker was added to the Huskies of Honor. He became the first men's basketball player to receive the distinction since the inaugural class was announced in December 2006. Walker announced his decision to leave UConn for the NBA on April 12. Accordingly, he entered the 2011 NBA draft and was selected 9th overall by the Charlotte Bobcats. Walker signed a multi-year shoe deal with Under Armour, the first rookie from the 2011 Draft Class to do so. On December 11, 2011, he signed the rookie scale contract with the Bobcats, and with the injury of point guard D. J. Augustin, he became their starting point guard for the lockout-shortened season. On January 28, 2012, in a home game against the Washington Wizards, he achieved his first triple-double with 20 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds, joining Boris Diaw and Stephen Jackson as the only Bobcats in team history to record one. Walker participated in the 2012 Rising Stars Challenge during All-Star Weekend. On November 14, 2012, Walker hit the first game-winner of his NBA career against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He finished the game with 22 points on 9-of-19 shooting, as well as 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 steals. On January 21, 2013, he scored a then career-high 35 points against the Houston Rockets. During the 2012–13 season, Walker was selected with teammate Michael Kidd-Gilchrist to the 2013 Rising Stars Challenge in which they both scored 8 points. Kemba finished the 2012–13 season with averages of 17.7 points, 5.7 assists, 3.5 rebounds, and 2 steals per contest. He took significant strides over his rookie year. On December 9, 2013, Walker scored 31 points, with 27 in the second half, and scored the final 15 points to help the Bobcats defeat the Golden State Warriors 115–111. On December 18, 2013, he hit a buzzer-beating jump shot over Jonas Valančiūnas in overtime to beat the Toronto Raptors. He finished the night with 26 points and 5 rebounds on 10/18 shooting from the field. On February 19, 2014, Walker recorded 24 points, 5 rebounds and a career-high 16 assists in a 116–98 win over the Detroit Pistons. Five days later, he was awarded the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, having averaged 22.5 points, 8.8 assists, and 5.5 rebounds in the span of seven days. In a home victory over the Orlando Magic on April 4, 2014, Walker recorded his second career triple-double with 13 points, 10 assists, and 10 rebounds. Playing against the Miami Heat in the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs and with teammate Al Jefferson unable to play due to a Plantar fasciitis injury, Walker had an exceptional game four: he finished the game with a playoff franchise-high 29 points, along with 5 assists, 5 rebounds, 3 blocks, and 2 steals. The effort came in a loss as the Heat completed a four-game sweep of the Bobcats. In the newly renamed Charlotte Hornets' opening game against the Milwaukee Bucks on October 29, Walker led an impressive comeback in an overtime 108–106 victory. The Hornets had been 24 points down by the fourth quarter when they staged a comeback; Walker scored a three-pointer with 1.6 seconds left to force overtime and later hit the shot that clinched the game as well. He finished with 26 points, 5 assists, and 6 rebounds. The following day, he signed a four-year, $48 million contract extension with the Hornets. On December 5, 2014, Walker hit his second game-winner of the season in a 103–102 win over the New York Knicks. On December 27, in a 94–102 loss to the Orlando Magic, he scored a then career-high 42 points and set a Charlotte Hornets franchise record for most points scored in a half with his 35 points that he posted in the second. On January 3, against the Orlando Magic, Walker scored 30 points to pass Kendall Gill for 10th place on the Charlotte Hornets all-time scoring list with 4,160 points. In three back-to-back games played between the 3rd and the 7th of January, Walker scored 30, 33, and 31 points in victories over the Orlando Magic, the Boston Celtics, and the New Orleans Pelicans respectively; he thereby joined Larry Johnson, Glen Rice, and Kelly Tripucka as one of four players in Charlotte Hornets' franchise history to have three or more consecutive games of scoring 30-plus points. Walker also hit his fifth game-winner of his career and his third of the season on January 7 in the 98–94 victory over the Pelicans. On January 12, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, January 5, through Sunday, January 11. Over the week, he led the Hornets to a 4–0 record and averaged 30.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 4.5 assists in 36.2 minutes, while shooting .500 from the field (44–88), .364 from beyond the three-point line (8–22) and .893 from the free-throw line (25–28). On January 28, 2015, Walker was ruled out for six weeks after he underwent successful surgery to repair a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee.

Wall plays the point guard position and is a five-time NBA All-Star. He was named to his first All-NBA Team in 2017. Wall was born on September 6, 1990 to Frances Pulley and John Carroll Wall Sr. When he was a year old, his father, who had previously served time in prison for second-degree murder, was convicted of armed robbery. Wall Sr. was released from prison on August 24, 1999, but died of liver cancer a month later at the age of 52.Wall's older half-brother, John Carroll Wall Jr., promised at their father's funeral to take care of the family, but was incarcerated the next year and released in 2018.Throughout Wall's childhood, his mother worked multiple jobs to support him and his sister, Cierra, along with his half-sister, Tonya.The death of his father caused Wall to frequently reject the authority of adults and led him down a path of acting up that entailed occasional fighting, mostly in middle school.He was cited for breaking and entering as a teenager.Wall played for two AAU basketball teams, first Garner Road and then D-One Sports. Wall played his first two years of high school basketball at Garner Magnet High School in Garner, North Carolina. After his second season, however, his family moved to Raleigh, where he repeated his sophomore year at Needham B. Broughton High School. Despite Wall having a very impressive tryout, he was cut from the school's varsity team for attitude related issues. For this reason, he transferred to Word of God Christian Academy, also in Raleigh. It was there that Wall set about the reform of his attitude and related issues. Coach Levi Beckwith worked with Wall, first to stop demeaning his teammates for missed layups, and later to improve his facial expressions and general demeanor.On the heels of his second sophomore year of high school, in the summer of 2007, Wall was invited to the prestigious Reebok All-American Camp in Philadelphia; while there, he distinguished himself by scoring 28 points against a team that featured future lottery pick Brandon Jennings.In 2008, Wall played in the Elite 24 Hoops Classic, at which he scored 10 points and won co-MVP honors alongside Dominic Cheek, Maalik Wayns, and Lance Stephenson.

He later transferred to St. Thomas More Preparatory School in Oakdale, Connecticut in 2013. Watanabe rose to fame with this high school program, and was one of their most valuable players in the National Prep School Invitational as a senior in 2014. In college, he became the fourth Japanese-born Division I basketball player of all-time. Watanabe attended Jinsei Gakuen High School in Kagawa. He led the basketball team to the runner-up spot of the All-Japan High School Basketball Tournament in his final two years with the program. While in Jinsei Gakuen, Watanabe said his career goal was to make it to the NCAA and ultimately join the NBA.In late 2013, Watanabe traveled to the United States and attended St. Thomas More Preparatory School in Oakdale, Connecticut. At the conclusion of his sole high school season outside his native country, Watanabe averaged 13 points and 6 rebounds. He helped the team reach a 26-8 overall record and a ticket to the National Prep Championship game. On January 31, 2014, in his first appearance in the annual National Prep School Invitational, Watanabe added 12 points vs Suffield Academy. Against Canarias Basketball Academy from Spain, a 70-61 victory, he contributed 20 points and 6 rebounds.As a result, he was named to the National Prep School Invitational All-Tournament Team and garnered prestigious New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) Class AAA First Team All-League honors.Watanabe was also labeled ""the Chosen One"" by The Japan Times.After completing his high school years, Watanabe was rated a 77(three star recruit) by ESPN Recruiting Nation. He was also given a three-star rating by Scout.com and the same composite grade. In fall of 2014, George Washington Colonials men's basketball head coach Mike Lonergan received a phone call from Jamie Cosgrove, a coach at Trinity College who saw Watanabe play with St. Thomas More.Watanabe eventually committed to play for George Washington. This move allowed him to attend George Washington University for the 2014 year as a freshman.It was made official when Watanabe posted the message through Twitter, ""I've decided to go to George Washington University. The school has a good basketball team, too. I'm sure I'll have hard times both in basketball and academics, but I'll give it my best shot.""According to ESPN, his second option was Fordham, who gave Watanabe an offer to join their team as well.He became the first-ever Japanese-born man to be given an NCAA Division I basketball scholarship,and was only the fourth to ever play college basketball at that level. Regarding Watanabe's collegiate career, former Japanese college basketball player, KJ Matsui, said, ""It's good for Nabe-chan (Watanabe) to play at a competitive team, but he's going to have to battle for playing time."" The Colonials had four other recruits coming into the program for 2014–15: Anthony Swan, Darian Bryant, Matt Cimino, and Paul Jorgensen. Upon joining George Washington, feature profiles on Watanabe were published by several popular newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. The fact that he was an Asian player assuming an important role greatly increased his popularity. Half-Chinese player, Zach Chu, who competed with the Richmond Spiders men's basketball team, said, ""To see someone of Asian descent, and play as well as he does, it's cool for college basketball, really cool for the Asian community.""The George Washington athletics website received the second-most views from Japan in terms of pageviews by country, behind only the United States. On many occasions, he was congratulated on the school's campus itself.Watanabe spoke about his fame and legacy, ""Japanese are thinking Americans are bigger and taller and more athletic. They are thinking it's more difficult for Japanese to play in NCAA, but I'm playing right now, so I want to make other people come to the United States.""Although Asian players such as Matsui, Jeremy Lin, and Yuki Togashi had been the subject of racist comments in the past, Watanabe was yet to receive racial remarks in his first few years in the United States.Nevertheless, he stated, ""If they said something racist, I don't care.""Watanabe made his collegiate debut with the team on November 14, 2014. He finished the game with 8 points, 7 rebounds, 1 block, and a three-pointer, helping the team record their largest win since 1999. Watanabe hit a key three-pointer with 3 minutes and 32 seconds remaining to upset No. 11 Wichita State on December 25, 2014. On January 3, 2015, he scored a career-high 12 points against Saint Joseph's. In a loss vs La Salle, Watanabe scored double-digits for the sixth consecutive game. On March 7, Yuta set a new career high of 21 points against Massachusetts. For the season, he was named the Atlantic 10 Defensive Player of the Year, becoming the first Colonial to win the award. After going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, Watanabe played for the Brooklyn Nets in the 2018 NBA Summer League. Afterwards, he signed a two-way contract with the Memphis Grizzlies and their NBA G League affiliate, the Memphis Hustle. On October 27, 2018, Watanabe made his NBA debut, coming off from bench with two points and two rebounds in a 117–96 win over the Phoenix Suns. He became the second Japanese player to play in the NBA after Yuta Tabuse, who debuted with the Suns in 2004. Though he spent the majority of the season in the G League, the Memphis Grizzlies were third behind the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors in merchandise sold in Japan due to Watanabe's presence. Watanabe had a team-high 28 points (12-of-19 shooting) to go with seven rebounds, four blocks, two assists and two steals in the Hustle's 130-127 win over the Iowa Wolves on January 4, 2020. He scored a career-high 40 points on 14-of-20 shooting on January 22, in a win versus the Delaware Blue Coats. Watanabe was named Midseason All-NBA G League for the Western Conference. Japan national basketball team head coach Kimikazu Suzuki previously oversaw Watanabe's play in camps, saying at the time, ""He's not good enough to be on this team yet, but eventually he's going to be [Japan's] ace player. We all know his capabilities and we intend to help him develop."" Later while attending Jinsei Gakuen High School, Watanabe was called up by Suzuki to compete with the national team in 2013.He made his debut on the international stage at the 2013 East Asia Basketball Championship and stayed with Japan for the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship.At the event, Watanabe averaged 5.3 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 0.5 assists in four games played. He helped the team finish in ninth place. Watanabe has often been praised for his size, his listed height being 6 feet and 9 inches (2.06 meters). He stands taller than any basketball player born in Japan that has competed in the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Watanabe was noted as the tallest young Japanese player to be seen in over a decade after beginning to attend George Washington University. However, the Japan national team's coach Kimikazu Suzuki remarked that he is ""201 cm but can play like a guard.""[b] In the past, Watanabe has been compared with former Croatian NBA forward Toni Kukoč, who was known for his versatility.Kukoč stood 6'11"" but was said to have the skill set of a guard. Watanabe has been criticized because of his lack of weight and muscle. George Washington head coach Mike Lonergan said that he hoped that he weighed over 200 pounds by the start of his sophomore season.KJ Matsui commented on his frame as well, saying, ""If he puts more muscles and get big, he will be unstoppable.""Just after becoming a part of the George Washington basketball program, Watanabe supposedly lacked panache, with teammate Kevin Larsen commenting, ""We told him to find a new celebration because the one he had wasn't cutting it. He was, like, jumping in the air making a weird face. So we tried to help him find a new one.""Watanabe sometimes mimicks Carmelo Anthony, using the ""three to the dome"" celebration after making three-pointers. He fit in with the Colonials as a key bench player and an instrumental element of their rotation as a freshman. Watanabe is often awarded playing time in late-game situations.Head coach Mike Lonergan said, ""With Yuta, we have scoring off the bench. If I start Yuta, we have no scoring off the bench at all.""Watanabe was born on October 13, 1994, in Yokohama, Kanagawa, in Japan, and grew up in Miki, Kagawa. Watanabe was born into a family with a rich history in basketball. His mother, Kumi, played basketball for the Chanson V-Magic in the top leagues of Japan and competed with the Japan women's national team. His father also played for the Kumagai Gumi Bruins at the professional level.Watanabe's sister, Yuki, played with the Aisin AW Wings of the Women's Japan Basketball League.During his childhood, Watanabe's favorite NBA player was Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers, which are also his favorite basketball team.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/04/18/basketball/yuta-watanabe-makes-positive-impact-rookie/",26637,4471,2019-20,9.0,0.0,49.0,4.4,10.3,0.429,1.5,2.9,0.5,2.9,7.3,0.4,1.5,2.9,0.5,0.7,5.1,5.9,0.7,0.7,0.7,0.7,3.7,11.8,15.0,Memphis Grizzlies

He played college basketball for the LSU Tigers. Waters played at South Kent School, a private all-boys school in NW Connecticut, for three years. He transferred his senior year to Notre Dame High School in West Haven, Connecticut. He tried out for the Puerto Rico national basketball team's U-17 squad in 2015.As a senior, he was selected for the Jordan Brand Classic. He initially committed to Georgetown but decommitted after coach John Thompson III was fired.Ranked number 37 overall in his high school class by Rivals.com, Waters committed to LSU and coach Will Wade on June 5, 2017.Waters was the 2017 Gatorade and Register State Player of the Year in Connecticut.On November 22, 2017, Waters scored a season-high 39 points on 13-of-22 shooting in a 94-84 loss to Marquette.As a freshman at LSU, Waters averaged 15.9 points, 6.0 assists and 3.4 rebounds per game. His 198 assists broke the school record for assists by a freshman set by Ben Simmons. Waters was named to the Freshman All-SEC team and was the Freshman of the Year in Louisiana. After the season, Waters entered his name in the 2018 NBA draft but did not hire an agent to preserve his collegiate eligibility.He announced his return to LSU for his sophomore season on May 29, 2018.On June 20, 2019, Waters was selected with the 51st overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics.Waters played for the Celtics during the 2019 NBA Summer League season and averaged 10.0 points, 5.3 assists, 2.0 rebounds, and 2.0 steals in 22.5 minutes through the first four games helping the Celtics clinch the number one seed going into the tournament. On July 12, 2019, Waters' father was found dead at a Super 8 Hotel room in West Haven, Connecticut in an apparent suicide. Despite this tragic, unexpected loss, Waters played 32 minutes in the tournament game the following day, July 13. The Celtics fell short to the Grizzlies and were eliminated from Summer League Championship contention despite a 16 point effort from Waters. Waters concluded his 2019 Summer League run leading the team in minutes per game as well as averaging 11.2 points, a team high 4.8 assists, and 2.0 steals.

24867,4478,Paul Watson,Paul Watson,G,6-7,215.0,December 30 1994,"Phoenix, Arizona",False,/players/w/watsopa01.html,28.0,"[1, 28]","Paul Franklin Watson (born December 2, 1950) is a Canadian-American marine wildlife conservation and environmental activist, who founded the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an anti-poaching and direct action group focused on marine conservation and marine conservation activism. The tactics used by Sea Shepherd have attracted opposition, with the group accused of eco-terrorism by both the Japanese government and Greenpeace.Watson is a citizen of Canada and the United States. The Toronto native joined a Sierra Club protest against nuclear testing in 1969. He was a co-founder of Greenpeace, crewed and skippered for it and a founding board member in 1972. He has been credited by The New York Times, The New Yorker, and other publications with being a founder of Greenpeace. The documentary How to Change the World shows that Watson was indeed one of the original founding members of Greenpeace. Because Watson argued for a strategy of direct action that conflicted with the Greenpeace interpretation of nonviolence, he was ousted from the board in 1977 and subsequently left the organization. That same year, he formed the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The group was the subject of a reality show named Whale Wars. He promotes veganism,and a biocentric, rather than anthropocentric, worldview.Watson's activities have led to legal action from authorities in countries including the United States,Canada, Norway, Costa Rica and Japan. He was detained in Germany on an extradition request by Costa Rica in May 2012. The Interpol red notice was issued on September 14, 2012, at the request of Japan and Costa Rica.After staying at sea for 15 months, he returned to Los Angeles late October 2013, going through customs and ""was not arrested"". He appeared before a US appeals court on November 6, 2013, stating that neither he nor Sea Shepherd violated a 2012 order requiring them to leave whaling vessels alone. Although the United States is a signatory member of Interpol, Watson has not been detained for extradition to Japan or Costa Rica. He was living in Vermont, writing books. He has resided in Paris since July 1, 2014. In March 2019, Costa Rica dropped all charges against Watson and has removed the Interpol red notice. According to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Paul Watson was born in Toronto to Anthony Joseph Watson and Annamarie Larsen, and grew up in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, along with two sisters and three brothers. As a child he was a member of the Kindness Club, which he has credited with teaching him to ""respect and defend animals"". After working as a tour guide at Expo 67, the World's Fair that took place in Montreal in 1967, Watson moved to Vancouver. According to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, in 1968 and the early 1970s, he joined the Canadian Coast Guard, where he served aboard weatherships, search and rescue hovercraft, and buoy tenders. He signed up as a merchant seaman in 1969 with the Norwegian Consulate in Vancouver and shipped out on the 35,000 ton bulk carrier Bris as a deck hand. The Bris was registered in Oslo, Norway and manifested for the Indian Ocean and Pacific trade. Watson has one daughter Lilliolani (born 1980) with his first wife, Starlet Lum, who was a founding director of Greenpeace Quebec, Earthforce!, Project Wolf, and Sea Shepherd. His second wife, Lisa Distefano, a former Playboy model, was Sea Shepherd's Director of Operations during the Makah anti-whaling campaigns in Friday Harbor.His third wife, Allison Lance, is an animal rights activist and a volunteer crew member of Sea Shepherd. Watson has two grandchildren. Watson married his fourth wife Yana Rusinovich on February 14, 2015, in Paris, France. Watson and Rusinovich had a son, Tiger, on September 29, 2016. In October 1969, Watson joined a Sierra Club protest against nuclear testing at Amchitka Island. The group which formed as a result of that protest was the Don't Make a Wave Committee, which evolved into the group known today as Greenpeace. In the early 1970s, Watson was also active with the Vancouver Liberation Front and the Vancouver Yippies. Watson sailed as a crew member aboard the Greenpeace Too! ship in 1971 and skippered the Greenpeace boat Astral in 1972. Paul Watson continued as a crew member, skipper, and officer aboard several Greenpeace voyages throughout the mid-1970s. According to The New Yorker, The New York Times, and other sources, Watson was a founding member of Greenpeace, but the organization denies this stating he ""was an influential early member but not, as he sometimes claims, a founder."" Greenpeace claims that Watson joined Greenpeace on its Amchitka expedition, which they claim to be their second expedition, but Paul Watson claims that this was Greenpeace's first meeting. The first Sea Shepherd vessel, the Sea Shepherd, was purchased in December 1978 with assistance from the Fund for Animals and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Sea Shepherd soon established itself as one of the more controversial environmental groups, known for provocative direct action tactics. These tactics have included throwing objects onto the decks of whaling ships, the use of ""prop foulers"" in an attempt to sabotage the ships, boarding whaling vessels, and the scuttling of two ships in an Icelandic harbor. In January 2013, Watson relinquished captaincy of the Steve Irwin. The organization and its activities to halt whaling are the focus of a reality TV series, Whale Wars, airing on Animal Planet. In 2010, Watson personally received more than $120,000 from Sea Shepherd. Because of mounting legal complications, Watson has stepped down as head of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2013, to abide by an injunction barring him from proximity with Japanese whaling ships. After the resolution of legal issues involving the Japanese Institute for Cetacean Research, Watson returned as President of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Commander of the Sea Shepherd fleet. Watson was a field correspondent for Defenders of Wildlife from 1976 to 1980 and a field representative for the Fund for Animals from 1978 to 1981. Watson also was a co-founder of Friends of the Wolf and Earthforce Environmental Society. During the 1980s, Watson declared his support for Earth First! and cultivated friendships with David Foreman and Edward Abbey. He proclaimed Sea Shepherd to be the ""navy"" of Earth First! According to The New Yorker, Watson revived the 19th-century practice of tree spiking.Watson ran as an independent candidate in the 1980 Canadian Federal election in Vancouver Centre, proclaiming he wasn't a politician but an environmentalist. He received fewer than 100 votes. Watson did work with the Green Party of British Columbia in Vancouver in the 1980s and 90s. He ran for mayor in 1996, placing fourth. In April 2003, Watson was elected to the board of directors of the Sierra Club for a three-year term. In 2006, he did not seek re-election. He resigned from the board a month before his term ended, in protest against the organization's sponsorship of a ""Why I Hunt"" essay contest. In January 2008, Paul Watson was named by The Guardian as one of its ""50 people who could save the planet"" for the work of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Watson published Earthforce!, a guide to strategy for environmental activists in 1993. In it, he specifically endorsed the tactics of ""monkeywrenching"" previously described by Dave Foreman and Edward Abbey. According to Foreman in Eco-Defense—The Field Guide to Monkey-Wrenching— these are tactics of sabotage, covert activity, and direct action. Watson says he incorporated his own personal experience in writing the book. In Earthforce! An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy, Watson expressed disdain for the truthfulness of mainstream media: Watson was explicit about what he perceived to be the lack of truthfulness in mass media: ""If you do not know an answer, a fact, or a statistic, then simply follow the example of an American President and do as Ronald Reagan did—make it up on the spot and deliver the information confidently and without hesitation."" In a subsequent book, Ocean Warrior, Watson expanded on this view, saying: ""Survival in a media culture meant developing the skills to understand and manipulate media to achieve strategic objectives."" In 2007 Watson explained his view of needed population control and the future of humanity: Paul Watson continued as a crew member, officer, and skipper (in 1972) aboard several Greenpeace voyages throughout the mid-1970s. He considers himself a founding member of Greenpeace and Greenpeace International, a claim Greenpeace disputes despite being pointed out in the documentary, ""How to Change the World"" which shows that Watson was indeed one of the original founding members of Greenpeace. Watson has since accused Greenpeace of rewriting their history. In 1977, Watson was expelled from the Greenpeace's board of directors by a vote of 11 to 1 (Watson himself cast the single vote against it). The group felt his strong, ""front and center"" personality and frequently voiced opposition to Greenpeace's interpretation of ""nonviolence"" were too divisive. Watson subsequently left the group. The group has since labeled his actions at the time as those of a ""mutineer"" within their ranks. That same year, he founded his own group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. During an interview in 1978 with CBC Radio, Watson spoke out against Greenpeace (as well as other organizations) and their role and motives for the anti-sealing campaigns. Watson accused these organizations of campaigning against the Canadian seal hunt because it is an easy way to raise money and it is a profit maker for the organizations. Greenpeace has called Watson a violent extremist and will no longer comment on his activities.Watson was sentenced to 10 days in prison and fined $8,000 for his actions during a Canadian seal hunt protest in 1980. He was convicted of assaulting a fisheries officer. He was also found guilty under the Seal Protection Act for painting harp seal pups with red dye to devalue their pelts. Watson was arrested in 1993 in Canada on charges stemming from actions against Cuban and Spanish fishing boats off the coast of Newfoundland. In 1997, Watson was convicted in absentia and sentenced to serve 120 days in jail by a court in Lofoten, Norway on charges of attempting to sink the small scale Norwegian fishing and whaling vessel Nybrænna on December 26, 1992. Dutch authorities refused to hand him over to Norwegian authorities although he did spend 80 days in detention in the Netherlands pending a ruling on extradition before being released. There have not been any successful attempts at prosecuting Watson for his activities with Sea Shepherd since the trial in Newfoundland. Watson defends his actions as falling within international law, in particular Sea Shepherd's right to enforce maritime regulations against illegal whalers and sealers. Sea Shepherd activists Rod Coronado and David Howitt went to Iceland in 1986 and scuttled two whaling ships in port at Reykjavík and also damaged a whale meat processing factory. Watson took responsibility for the operation, abiding by published Sea Shepherd principles. He went to Iceland saying, ""I am responsible for all activities undertaken in the name of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. I give the orders."" He was deported without being charged and is considered a persona non grata by Iceland In April 2010 the Japanese Coast Guard obtained an arrest warrant for Watson ""...on suspicion of ordering sabotage activities against Japan's whaling fleet"", and Interpol has listed him as wanted at the request of Japan. The red notice has the charges issued by Japan as, ""Breaking into the Vessel, Damage to Property, Forcible Obstruction of Business, Injury"". In March 2012 Interpol issued a ""written statement to all 190 member countries making it clear that it would not publish a Red Notice"" for the detention of Watson, but reversed that position in September 2012. In both statements Interpol stated that a ""Red Notice is not an international arrest warrant"" that it is ""a request for any country to identify or locate an individual with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition in accordance with the country's national laws"". In May 2012 Watson was detained by German authorities at the Frankfurt Airport because of a request from the government of Costa Rica. The charge stemmed from an altercation at sea in 2002 in which Sea Shepherd said that the other vessel was illegally shark finning in Guatemalan waters. Crew members of the other ship accused Sea Shepherd of trying to kill them. Watson was charged with violating navigational regulations with the Interpol alert stating the charge as, ""peligro de naufragio"" (danger of shipwreck). The conflict took place during filming for the documentary Sharkwater and the charges were dropped by prosecutors after video of the incident made by the documentary film makers was shown. On May 21, Watson was released on bail of €250,000 but required to report to police in Frankfurt on a daily basis. In June, Costa Rica formally requested Watson's extradition from Germany. On July 19, 2012, Japan applied for an extradition order and Watson left Germany, resulting in a German court ordering his immediate re-arrest. It is understood the statute of limitations on his Costa Rican charges was set to expire in June 2013. On August 7, 2012 Interpol renewed the Red Notice for Watson on the charges of ""causing a danger of drowning or of an air disaster"" laid by Costa Rica. It was reported that Watson would come out of hiding to join Sea Shepherd in the 2012–13 campaign against Japanese whaling. Watson rejoined the crew of the Steve Irwin in the South Pacific in late November 2012. In March 2019, Costa Rica dropped all charges against Watson and has removed the Interpol red notice. In 1999, Watson ran unsuccessfully for election to the national Sierra Club Board of Directors, with the backing of the anti-immigration faction Sierrans for US Population Stabilization (SUSPS). After his election to the board in 2003, Watson supported an unsuccessful slate of candidates supporting strict immigration controls as an element of a population stabilization policy. This effort was denounced by another candidate in the election, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center, as a ""hostile takeover"" attempt by ""radical anti-immigrant activists."" Watson responded by saying that the only change he was seeking in the organization's immigration stance was to restore the position it had held before its 1996 ""neutrality policy."" Watson left the Sierra Club board in 2006. In April 2008, Watson stated that, while the deaths of three Canadian seal hunters (a fourth one is still missing) in a marine accident involving a Canadian Coast Guard vessel and a fishing boat during the 2008 Canadian Commercial Seal Hunt were a tragedy, he felt that the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of seals is an even greater tragedy. Canadian Federal Fisheries Minister Loyola Hearn accused Watson of trivializing the memory of the lost sealers. Watson replied that Hearn was trying to distract attention from his government's incompetence as the boat the men were on capsized while under tow by a Canadian Coast Guard vessel, while his political ambitions continued to support and subsidize an industry that had no place in the 21st century. In 1978, Watson expressed opposition to seal hunt protest organization, suggesting in an interview with CBC's Barbara Frum that saving seals is a cheap and easy fundraiser and that seals do not deserve special status over other species. Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams was quoted as saying, ""I think what a lot of people don't realize is that this man is a terrorist."" In October 2009, Watson, who carries a US passport, complained to media outlets about having his request for an Australian visa denied. He states that the Australian government was attempting to sabotage the upcoming 2010 Sea Shepherd campaign by denying him entry into the country. Watson and several other shipmates were also unable to join the Steve Irwin on its promotional tour of Australia until they were able to provide documentation from the governments of the United States, Canada and Norway, exonerating them from previously claimed acts of violence, specifically claims by Sea Shepherd of intentionally sinking a ship in Norway. In January 2013, Paul Watson was presented with an Aboriginal passport by the Krautungalung people of the Gunnai Nation. On March 17, 2008, Paul Watson said that he was shot by the Japanese crew or coast guard personnel during the Operation Migaloo anti-whaling campaign in the Southern Ocean. The incident is documented during the season finale of season 1 of the Whale Wars TV reality show, and the first six episodes are covered as a buildup to what is portrayed as the major incident during the campaign. The footage in Whale Wars shows Watson standing on the deck of the Steve Irwin while Sea Shepherd crew throws glass bottles filled with butyric acid at the Nisshin Maru whaling vessel. Butyric acid was used for its foul odor and sticky properties. The Japanese respond by throwing stun grenades, one crew member is injured from a grenade detonating close behind him and another injured trying to escape the explosions. Watson is then shown reaching inside his jacket and body armour and remarking ""I've been hit."" Back inside the bridge of the Steve Irwin, a metal fragment is found inside the vest. The Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research disputes Sea Shepherd's statements. The Institute and Coast Guard said that they used seven stun grenades designed to temporarily debilitate a target by rendering them blind and deaf for a period of time. The Japanese government also alleged that the whalers launched ""noise balls"", described as ""loud explosive deterrent devices"". Neither of the two conflicting accounts have been independently verified. The Australian Foreign Affairs Department had condemned ""actions by crew members of any vessel that cause injury"". Two media releases were made on the same day from the office. One said that the Australian Embassy in Tokyo had been informed by the Japanese that the whalers had ""fired warning shots"" while the updated version used the phrase ""'warning balls' – also known as 'flashbangs' – had been fired"". Watson has been called an eco-terrorist by the Japanese government for his direct action tactics against whalers, and it repeated its position after conflicts during the 2009–10 whaling season.At an animal rights convention in 2002, Paul Watson was also quoted as saying, ""There's nothing wrong with being a terrorist, as long as you win. Then you write the history."" In 2010, Fox News commentator Glenn Beck also discussed the comment, criticizing Watson's views. Watson responded to Beck's comments on the official Sea Shepherd website by stating that he had said that but that it was taken out of context, quoting Gerald Seymour's ""One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter."" Watson was criticized for his poem published immediately following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami which suggested the disaster was Neptune's anger.[non-primary source needed] Watson responded to critics with a commentary on the Sea Shepherd website expressing ""deepest concern and sympathy for the people of Japan who are suffering through one of the worst natural disasters in the history of civilization"". In 2013, three Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ships docked in New Zealand, and were searched by New Zealand authorities to see if Watson was aboard. He was not, having transferred to another ship in international waters, aware New Zealand was required to notify Interpol if he entered the country. Watson criticised the search, accusing New Zealand of siding with Japan on the issue of whaling in the Southern Ocean. Watson has stated that he does not consider himself a 'protester', but an 'interventionist', as he considers protesting as too submissive. He often takes the attitude that he represents (or stands in for) law enforcement which is either unwilling or unable to enforce existing laws. His leadership style has variously been called arrogant, as well as pushing himself too much ""front and center"", which was cited as one of the reasons for expulsion from Greenpeace. The atmosphere aboard his vessels has been compared to an ""anarchy run by God"". The former member of Sea Shepherd and captain of the MY Ady Gil Pete Bethune described Watson as ""morally bankrupt"" who would order the intentional sinking of his own ships like the Ady Gil as a means to ""garner sympathy with the public and to create better TV"". Watson denied this, saying ""No one ordered him to scuttle it. Pete Bethune was captain of the Ady Gil; all decisions on the Ady Gil were his."" Paul Watson received the Jules Verne Award on October 10, 2012. He was the second person after Captain Jacques Cousteau to be honored with a Jules Verne Award dedicated to environmentalists and adventurers. On June 28, 2010 Paul received the Asociación de Amigos del Museo de Anclas Philippe Cousteau: Defense of Marine Life Award, in recognition of his merits achieved by the work done in defense of marine life.

Captain Paul Watson received the Cinema for Peace Heroes award at the Heroes event in Los Angeles on 8th February 2020. A biographical documentary on Paul Watson's early life and background entitled Pirate for the Sea was produced by Ron Colby in 2008. The 2008 documentary At the Edge of the World chronicled the efforts of Watson and 45 volunteers to hinder the Japanese whaling fleet in the waters around Antarctica. In 2010, long time friend and filmmaker Peter Brown released the documentary Confessions of an Eco-Terrorist, a satirical look back at the last 30 years of actions. The documentary Eco-Pirate: The Story of Paul Watson from 2011 features interviews and footage with early Greenpeace members Rex Weyler and Patrick Moore. Watson, Whale Wars, and the Japanese whaling industry were satirized in the South Park episode ""Whale Whores"". In its fictional Larry King show, Watson himself was called ""An unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was OK as long as it served his cause"" and ""A smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility"". Watson responded to the South Park episode by stating; ""My understanding is that the Japanese Prime Minister was not amused and the whalers and dolphin killers are enraged at the way they were portrayed,"" Watson said. ""That's music to my ears. If the humorless whale killers and the bank rollers of the dolphin killers did not like the show, then that's all I need to applaud it."" Watson was portrayed (along with whale biologist, Nan Hauser), during a 60 Minutes episode that aired in 2013, as contributing to the return of the Humpback whale populations in the South Pacific. In 2019 a biopic film called, ""Watson"" from the Director of Inconvenient Truth, ""Lesley Chilcott"" was released and also aired on Animal Planet on December 22nd, 2019.",26641,4478,2019-20,2.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.2,14.4,0.5,0.0,7.2,7.2,7.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.2,28.0,Toronto Raptors

He was selected with the fourth overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, who then relocated to Oklahoma City six days later. Westbrook has represented the United States national team twice, winning gold medals in the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics. Westbrook was born in Long Beach, California, to Russell Westbrook Jr. and Shannon Horton. He has a younger brother named Raynard.Growing up in Hawthorne,Westbrook and his best friend, Khelcey Barrs III, had hopes of going to UCLA and playing together. However, in May 2004, Barrs died from an enlarged heart during a pickup game. Westbrook entered Leuzinger High School as a point guard who stood only 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) tall and weighed only 140 pounds (64 kg), although he did have large (size-14) feet. He did not start on his school's varsity team until his junior year, and did not receive his first college recruiting letter until the summer before his senior year. Westbrook grew to his adult height of 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) that same summer. During his senior year, Westbrook averaged 25.1 points, 8.7 rebounds, 3.1 steals, and 2.3 assists and helped lead them to a 25-4 record. That same season, he recorded 14 double-doubles, scored 30 or more points on eight separate occasions, and registered a career-best 51 points at Carson on January 6, 2006. Westbrook did not attract much attention from top college basketball programs until head coach Ben Howland offered him a scholarship to play for the UCLA Bruins after Jordan Farmar declared for the NBA draft. Westbrook wore number 0 throughout his career at UCLA. As a freshman in 2006–07, he played as a back up to Darren Collison and was primarily used as a defender and energy player off the bench. Westbrook averaged 3.4 points, 0.8 rebounds, and 0.7 assists on the year. The next season, Collison was injured and Westbrook was named the starter. He finished the season averaging 12.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 1.6 steals. At the end of the year, he was named All-Pac-10 Third Team and won the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year. UCLA advanced to the Final Four during each of Westbrook's seasons with the team. In 2007, they lost to eventual national champion Florida, 76–66 and in 2008, they lost 78–63 to Memphis. After two years at UCLA, he decided to forgo his final two years and enter the 2008 NBA draft. Westbrook was selected 4th overall in the 2008 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics (which then relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder six days later). He signed with the team on July 5, 2008. On March 2, 2009, Westbrook recorded his first career triple-double with 17 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He was the first rookie since Chris Paul and the third rookie in Sonics/Thunder franchise history (Art Harris and Gary Payton) to record a triple-double. Westbrook averaged 15.3 points, 5.3 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.3 steals on the season. He finished fourth in the 2008–09 NBA Rookie of the Year voting behind Rookie of the Year winner Derrick Rose (Chicago Bulls), O. J. Mayo (Memphis Grizzlies) and Brook Lopez (New Jersey Nets). He was named to the NBA's NBA All-Rookie First Team. In his second year, and first season as a full-time starter, Westbrook went on to average 16.1 points, 8.0 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.3 steals on the season. On April 4, 2010, he recorded 10 points and a career-high 16 assists in a 116-108 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Thunder made a huge turnaround by more than doubling their wins from the previous season and qualified for the playoffs with a 50–32 record. However, the Thunder were eliminated by the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. In the series, Westbrook stepped up his play from the regular season, averaging 20.5 points, 6.0 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 3.2 steals. On November 26, 2010, Westbrook scored a then-career-high 43 points against the Indiana Pacers. On December 1, 2010, he scored 38 points with 9 assists and achieved a new career-high of 15 rebounds in a triple-overtime win over the New Jersey Nets. Westbrook was selected by the NBA head coaches to be a Western Conference reserve for the 2011 NBA All-Star Game. This was his first all-star appearance. Westbrook finished the season with averages of 21.9 points, 8.2 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.9 steals. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time. The Thunder finished the season at 55–27 and lost to the eventual world champion Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals.

He joined Michael Jordan as the only players with 25+ points and 10+ assists in their NBA Finals debut. In a Game 4 loss, Westbrook scored a playoff career high 43 points. Westbrook was once again selected for the NBA All-Star Game. He finished the 2012–13 season averaging 23.2 points, 7.4 assists, 5.2 rebounds, and 1.8 steals per game. Westbrook helped lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to the playoffs and the #1 seed in the Western Conference. They would go on to face the 8th seed Houston Rockets in the first round. On April 25, 2013, in the second game of the series, Westbrook injured his right knee when Rockets guard Patrick Beverley collided with him in an attempt to steal the ball. Although Westbrook was clearly bothered by the injury, he would continue playing and finished the game with 29 points. It was then revealed the next day that he had suffered a slight tear in his right meniscus. He had surgery on April 27, 2013, and was declared out for the rest of the playoffs. Without Westbrook, the Thunder defeated the Rockets in 6 games, but fell to the Memphis Grizzlies in 5 games in the next round. Westbrook was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the third consecutive year. Prior to the start of the 2013–14 season, Westbrook had a second surgery on his right knee, which set back his return to basketball. Despite reports that he would miss the first two weeks of the regular season, Westbrook would miss only the first two games. On December 25, 2013, Westbrook recorded 14 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists as Oklahoma City beat the New York Knicks 123-94. This was just the eighth triple-double on Christmas Day in NBA history. The win was also the largest margin of victory in a Christmas Day game in NBA history. On the day after his Christmas-day game, it was announced that Westbrook would undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right knee and would be out until after the All-Star break. During this time, The Thunder were able to remain competitive despite his absence due mainly to Kevin Durant's stellar play. Westbrook returned to the lineup on February 20, 2014. He played the rest of the season on limited minutes and sat out the second night of back-to-backs. On March 4, 2014, Westbrook recorded his second triple-double of the season. He recorded 13 points, 14 assists, and 10 rebounds, in just 20 minutes in a 125–92 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. This was the second fastest recorded triple-double in NBA history. Westbrook and the Thunder finished with a 59-23 record earning the #2 seed in the Western Conference. They advanced to the Western Conference Finals where they faced the San Antonio Spurs. On May 27, 2014, in a Game 4 victory, Westbrook recorded 40 points, 5 rebounds, 10 assists and 5 steals. In doing so, he joined Michael Jordan as the only other player to post those numbers in a playoff game. The Thunder lost the series to the eventual NBA champion Spurs in six games. Westbrook averaged 26.7 points, 8.1 assists, and 7.3 rebounds in the postseason, and became the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1964 to average at least 26 points, 8 assists, and 7 rebounds in the playoffs. After scoring 38 points in a 106–89 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2014–15 season opener, Westbrook suffered a small fracture of the second metacarpal in his right hand the following game against the Los Angeles Clippers and subsequently missed 14 games with the injury. He joined Kevin Durant on the sidelines after Durant fractured his right foot during preseason and was ruled out for six to eight weeks. With the pair both inactive for the start of the season, the Thunder dropped to a 4–12 record prior to Westbrook's return on November 28 against the New York Knicks. In Westbrook's first game back, he led the Thunder to a win over the Knicks with 32 points. Durant returned the following game to face the New Orleans Pelicans, as the pair helped the Thunder go on a seven-game winning streak to bring the Thunder back into playoff contention. On January 16, 2015, Westbrook recorded his ninth career triple-double with 17 points, 15 rebounds and a career-high 17 assists in a 127–115 win over the Golden State Warriors, becoming just the fifth player in NBA history to record a stat line of 15–15–15 in a game. After tying a career-high 45 points on February 4, 2015 in a 102–91 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, Westbrook broke that mark to score a new career-high of 48 points two days later, this time in a 116–113 loss to the Pelicans. After being injured the previous year, Westbrook returned to the All-Star game in 2015. He tallied 41 points, and was named the All-Star MVP. He scored 27 points in 11 minutes in the first half, setting an All-Star record for points in a half, and finished one point shy of the All-Star game record set by Wilt Chamberlain (42) in 1962. On February 22, Westbrook recorded 21 points and tied a career-high 17 assists in a 119–94 win over the Denver Nuggets. Two days later, he recorded 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a 105–92 win over the Indiana Pacers.

On February 27, in a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, Westbrook recorded 40 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists to become the first player to have three straight triple-doubles since LeBron James did so in 2009. Westbrook finished the month of February averaging 31.2 points, 9.1 rebounds and 10.3 assists per game, and became just the second player in NBA history to average 30 points, 9 rebounds and 10 assists per game for a calendar month with at least 10 games played, joining Robertson, who accomplished the feat multiple times. On March 4, Westbrook set career-highs with 49 points and 16 rebounds, and added 10 assists for his fourth consecutive triple-double, helping the Thunder defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 123–118 in overtime. He subsequently became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989 to have four consecutive triple-doubles, and the first since Jordan that year to have back-to-back triple-doubles with at least 40 points. It was also the most points by any player with a triple-double since Larry Bird also scored 49 in 1992. His streak came to an end the following night against the Chicago Bulls as he recorded 43 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a 105–108 loss. On March 8, he recorded his fifth triple-double in six games to help the Thunder defeat the Toronto Raptors, 108–104. He had 30 points, matched a career-high with 17 assists and grabbed 11 rebounds for his seventh triple-double of the season and 15th of his career. In much too similar fashion, Westbrook recorded yet another triple-double on March 13 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, collecting his sixth in eight games and scored 15 of his 29 points (with 12 assists and 10 rebounds) in the fourth quarter, helping the Thunder pull away for a 113–99 win. He went on to record three more triple-doubles to finish the season. On April 12, he scored a career-high 54 points on 21-of-43 shooting in a losing effort to the Indiana Pacers. He went on to help the Thunder win the final two games of the 2014–15 season, but it was not enough to position the Thunder in the playoffs, as they finished ninth in the West with a 45–37 record. To begin the 2015–16 season, Westbrook and Kevin Durant both dropped 40 points against the Orlando Magic on October 30, becoming the first teammates in NBA history to do so multiple times, having previously done it in 2012. In December against Denver, they became the first teammates to each have at least 25 points and 10 assists in a regulation game since 1996. On January 4, he was named Western Conference co-Player of the Month for December alongside Durant. On January 20, 2016, Westbrook recorded 16 points, 15 assists, eight rebounds, and five steals against the Charlotte Hornets, becoming just the fourth player in NBA history with at least 15 points, 15 assists, five rebounds and five steals in a game.

Westbrook was voted to start in his first All-Star Game in 2016, and he earned his second MVP award after a 196–173 win by the West. He recorded 31 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and five steals in 22 minutes, and became the first player in All-Star history to win consecutive MVPs outright. Bob Pettit is the other player to have won two back-to-back awards, winning in 1958 and sharing it with Elgin Baylor in 1959. On March 9, he recorded his 11th triple-double of the season with 25 points, a career-high 20 assists and 11 rebounds in a 120–108 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. The stat line marked the NBA's first triple-double with at least 25 points, 20 assists and 10 rebounds since Magic Johnson did it for the Los Angeles Lakers in 1988, and the first with at least 20 points and 20 assists since Rod Strickland did it for the Washington Wizards in 1998. On March 22, he recorded his 15th triple-double of the season and 34th of his career with 21 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds in a 111–107 win over the Houston Rockets, setting the most triple-doubles by a player in a season since 1988–89, when Magic Johnson had 17 and Michael Jordan had 15. It was also Westbrook's sixth triple-double in March, the most by a player in a calendar month since Jordan had seven in April 1989. On April 11, with his 18th triple-double of the season in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, he tied Magic Johnson (1981–82) for the most in a single season in the past 50 seasons. In the playoffs, Westbrook helped guide the Thunder past the Dallas Mavericks in the first round, and then the San Antonio Spurs in the second round. In the Western Conference Finals, they faced the defending champion Golden State Warriors, and took home court advantage after stealing Game 1 of the series. With the series tied at 1–1 after Game 2, the Thunder returned home and took a 3–1 advantage with two home wins. In Game 4, Westbrook recorded his fifth career playoff triple-double with 36 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in a 118–94 win. Despite going up 3–1 in the series, the Thunder were defeated 4–3 by the Warriors to bow out of the playoffs. Following the off-season departure of Kevin Durant, trade speculation began swirling around Westbrook, with his contract set to expire in 2017. The Thunder were determined to keep Westbrook and held off all trade talks in order to work out an extension. On August 4, 2016, Westbrook signed a three-year, $85.7 million contract extension with the Thunder. In the Thunder's second game of 2016–17 on October 28, Westbrook recorded his 38th career regular season triple-double with 51 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in a 113–110 overtime win over the Phoenix Suns, marking the first 50-point triple-double since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had one in 1975. Westbrook also took a career-high 44 shots. Two days later, he recorded 33 points, 12 rebounds and 16 assists in a 113–96 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, joining Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Jerry Lucas as the only players in NBA history with two triple-doubles in the first three games of a season. On November 30, he recorded his fourth straight triple-double with 35 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in a 126–115 overtime win over the Washington Wizards, becoming just the second player in NBA history to average a triple-double heading into December (joining Robertson). He extended that streak to seven straight on December 9 with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 102–99 loss to the Houston Rockets—the longest triple-double streak since Michael Jordan had seven straight in 1989. Forty-one games into the season, Westbrook was averaging 30.8 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 10.5 assists per game, marking the latest anyone had averaged a triple-double since Robertson in 1966–67, when he became the first player to average a triple-double for an entire season (30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists). On January 15, 2017, Westbrook had 36 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his 20th triple-double of the season, as he helped the Thunder defeat the Sacramento Kings 122–118. He joined Robertson (five times) and Wilt Chamberlain (twice) as the only players in NBA history to record 20 triple-doubles in a season. His 21st triple-double of the season came on January 18 in a loss to former teammate Durant and the Golden State Warriors. On January 23, Westbrook hit a pull-up jumper with 1.4 seconds left to lift the Thunder to a 97–95 win over the Utah Jazz. He finished with 38 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for his 22nd triple-double of the season and No. 59 for his career, tying Larry Bird for fifth on the career list. Two days later, he had 27 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a 114–105 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, thus passing Bird with his 60th career triple-double. Heading into All-Star Weekend, Westbrook was averaging 31.1 points, 10.5 rebounds and 10.1 assists in 57 games. Westbrook went on to record three straight triple-doubles coming out of the All-Star break, giving him 67 for his career and 30 on the season. On March 7, Westbrook's career-high 58 points was not enough to lift the Thunder over the Portland Trail Blazers, losing 126–121. His 31st triple-double of the season, which came on March 9 against the San Antonio Spurs, matched Wilt Chamberlain's 1967–68 campaign for the second-most in a season. He surpassed Chamberlain's record with his 32nd triple-double on March 11 against the Jazz. Westbrook went on to tie Robertson's single-season record of 41 triple-doubles on April 4 against the Milwaukee Bucks. Westbrook also moved into a tie with Chamberlain for fourth on the career list with his 78th triple-double. Three days later, he joined Robertson (in 1961–62) as the only players in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season, needing just six assists against the Phoenix Suns to clinch the triple-double average. His historic 42nd triple-double, to break Robertson's record of most triple-doubles in a season, came in a 106–105 away victory against the Denver Nuggets on April 9. Westbrook scored 18 of his 50 points in the last five minutes, including a 36-foot game-winning buzzer-beater, to overcome a 14-point deficit. As a result, Westbrook moved into fourth place for most triple-doubles in NBA history with 79, surpassing Chamberlain's 78. It was his third career 50-point triple-double, all of which came in 2016–17, the most by any player in NBA history. The Thunder finished the regular season with a 47–35 record and entered the playoffs as the No. 6 seed. On April 19, in Game 2 of the Thunder's first-round playoff series against the Rockets, Westbrook had 51 points in the highest-scoring triple-double in playoff history. Westbrook set a franchise playoff scoring record and added 13 assists and 10 rebounds, marking his sixth career playoff triple-double. Despite his efforts, the Thunder lost 115–111 to go down 2–0 in the series. In Game 4 four days later, Westbrook had 35 points, 14 rebounds and 14 assists, but could not lead the Thunder to a win, as they went down 3–1 in the series with a 113–109 loss. Westbrook joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to claim three consecutive playoff triple-doubles. With a loss to the Rockets in Game 5, the Thunder bowed out of the playoffs with a 4–1 series defeat. Westbrook had 47 points in Game 5 and came up just one assist shy of his fourth straight triple-double. On June 26, 2017, he was named the recipient of the NBA Most Valuable Player Award at the first-ever NBA Awards Show. On September 29, 2017, Westbrook signed a five-year, $205 million contract extension with the Thunder. The deal starts with the 2018–19 season and delivers Westbrook the biggest guaranteed contract in NBA history—six seasons and $233 million through 2022–23. It includes a player option on the 2022–23 season. Continuing on from his historic 2016–17 season, Westbrook had a triple-double in the Thunder's season opener against the New York Knicks on October 19.

Westbrook will often look to push the pace of the game for transition points and attack the basket. Though attacking the rim is his forte, he will frequently pull up for medium range jump shots. He regularly creates good scoring opportunities for his teammates, resulting in him averaging over eight assists per game for his career. Westbrook is widely recognized as one of the best all-around players in the NBA. His 138 regular season triple-doubles is ranked equal second-most all-time and his 10 playoff triple-doubles is tied for fourth-most all-time. Forty-two of his 138 regular season triple-doubles came during the 2016–17 season, breaking Oscar Robertson's single-season record of 41, a record he set during the 1961–62 season. He subsequently joined Robertson as the only players in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season. He, along with Lebron Jame, is the only player to record a triple-double against every NBA team. The following two seasons also saw Westbrook clinch a triple-double average, as he had 25 triple-doubles in 2017–18 and 34 in 2018–19. He has the most rebounds in NBA history of guards who is 6’3” or shorter. Westbrook's three-point shooting and turnovers are often brought to attention when pundits criticize his game.

On December 9, he recorded three blocks against the Charlotte Hornets, thus opening the season with two or more blocks in all 20 games, trailing only Mark Eaton (24, 1988–89 with Utah) and Shaquille O'Neal (23, 1992–93 with Orlando) for longest streaks to start a season. His streak ended at 21 after he failed to record a block on December 13 against the Memphis Grizzlies.

Whiteside also recorded his 57th double-digit rebound game of the season, a Heat record—one more than Seikaly in 1991–92. On April 2 against Denver, Whiteside became the first Heat player to record 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds in a season. Whiteside finished the season as the league's leading rebounder.

On November 20, he had 21 points and 23 rebounds in a 104–92 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. In March 2019, he was relegated to a reserve role after coming off a hip injury.

Whiteside is the son of Hassan Arbubakrr and Debbie Whiteside. His father played in the NFL for the Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1983 to 1984. Whiteside has a younger brother named Nassan, who has autism. In 2012, Nassan's Place was incorporated in the state of New Jersey as a non-profit organization. Nassan's Place provides low to moderate income families the opportunity to receive quality and affordable care for their children in a safe and carefree environment. In January 2017, Whiteside wired $2.75 million to attorney Michael Avenatti as the first payment in a $3 million-settlement with ex-girlfriend Alexis Gardner, who was represented by Avenatti in the settlement. Avenatti allegedly embezzled all but $194,000 of the $3 million that Whiteside paid in total, even though he was legally entitled to only a little more than $1 million in legal fees. This news came to light during an April 10, 2019 indictment of Avenatti by a federal grand jury in Santa Ana, California. “We entered into a mutually agreed upon settlement more than two years ago following the end of our relationship; a settlement that reflected Alexis’ investment of time and support over a number of years as Hassan pursued a career in the NBA,” Whiteside and Gardner told the Los Angeles Times in a statement released by his agent.",26646,4557,2019-20,51.0,51.0,1570.0,7.6,12.4,0.613,0.0,0.1,0.5,7.6,12.3,0.613,3.1,4.4,0.71,4.7,11.8,16.5,1.4,0.5,3.5,2.2,3.5,18.4,25.0,Portland Trail Blazers

On June 20, 2019, the New Orleans Pelicans drafted Williamson with the first pick in the 2019 NBA draft. On July 1, 2019, Williamson officially signed with the Pelicans. Zion tore his meniscus on October 13, 2019, during the preseason of his rookie campaign. Williamson made his professional debut three months later on January 22, 2020, in a 121–117 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. He played 18 minutes and finished with 22 points and 7 rebounds, scoring 17 consecutive points in 3:08 minutes during the fourth quarter. Williamson is listed at 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall in shoes and weighs 285 pounds (129 kg). Despite his heavy weight for a basketball player, he is known for his speed and leaping ability. NBA player Kevin Durant described him as a ""once-in-a-generation type athlete"" while an anonymous college basketball coach labeled him a ""freak of nature"". Williamson plays the power forward position but is also capable of being a small-ball center. However, he is best played as a forward due to his size. He has been described as not fitting a specific basketball position. His physical attributes have drawn comparisons to former NBA stars Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson. In addition, according to different analysts, he resembles NBA players LeBron James and Julius Randle. Lee Sartor, Williamson's high school coach, reported that basketball coach Roy Williams told Williamson ""that he was probably one of the best high school players he's seen since Michael Jordan"". Williamson, who is left-handed, is almost ambidextrous, being adept using either hand. While in high school, Williamson drew national attention for his slam dunks. The Charlotte Observer remarked that he ""could be the best high-school dunker in history"". NBA point guard John Wall has likened Williamson's in-game dunking ability to that of Vince Carter. Williamson's outside shooting has been considered a point of concern, and he has unorthodox shot mechanics. Recruiting service 247Sports has praised his ball handling and passing skills for his size, commenting that they are ""overshadowed by [his] athletic plays"". Williamson has the ability to defend multiple positions well due to his speed and length, although his defensive effort has been questioned. His explosive play makes him a reliable shot-blocker and gives him prowess as a rebounder. Williamson was born in Salisbury, North Carolina to Lateef Williamson and Sharonda Sampson. Lateef was a football defensive lineman at Mayo High School in Darlington, South Carolina who was a 1993 High School All-American and had committed to NC State before transferring to Livingstone College. Sampson was a sprinter at Livingstone and became a middle school health and physical education teacher. She named Williamson after the biblical location Mount Zion near Jerusalem, taking her grandmother's advice to name him ""something extra special"".When Williamson reached two years of age, following the death of his maternal grandmother, his family moved to Florence, South Carolina. By the time he was five years old, his parents divorced, and his mother married Lee Anderson, a former Clemson basketball player.On July 23, 2019, Williamson signed a five-year, $75 million shoe deal with Jordan brand. Williamson's deal is the second-largest rookie shoe deal in history, trailing only LeBron James's $90 million rookie deal signed in 2003.",26659,4669,2019-20,10.0,10.0,274.0,10.9,18.9,0.576,0.5,1.4,0.364,10.4,17.5,0.594,6.7,10.2,0.654,4.6,5.3,9.9,2.9,0.9,0.5,3.7,2.2,29.0,19.0,New Orleans Pelicans

Wilson,DeVante Jaylen Wilson,F,6-10,231.0,February 19 1996,"Mount Shasta, California",False,/players/w/wilsodj01.html,17.0,[17],"DeVante Jaylen Wilson (born February 19, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines and completed his junior season for the 2016–17 team. He was drafted 17th overall in the 2017 NBA draft by the Bucks. At Capital Christian School in Sacramento, Wilson endured a fifth lumbar vertebra stress fracture, which sidelined him during the summer of 2012 and part of his junior season, which caused him to lose the attention of some recruiters.He spent three months in a back brace from his hips to his chest.By the middle of his junior season, he completed a 1-year 5-inch growth spurt that took him to a height of 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m). By June 2013, he had recovered enough to tally 22 points and 8 rebounds against Ivan Rabb at a California Golden Bears camp event at Haas Pavilion. Soon thereafter, Michigan and other schools began recruiting him. The defending 2013 national runner-up Wolverines hosted him (and Devin Booker) during the first weekend of October 2013 and he accepted Michigan over offers from USC, Gonzaga, Northwestern, and Harvard.Wilson signed his National Letter of Intent with Michigan on November 13, 2013, with the expectation that Jordan Morgan would graduate from the 2013–14 Wolverines team and both Glenn Robinson III and Mitch McGary would enter the 2014 NBA draft. At the time of his signing, he was believed to be the first Sacramento area player to ever sign with a Big Ten Conference school.Wilson posted 29 points for Capital Christian School against Rabb and Bishop O'Dowd High School in the Northern California Open Division championship loss on March 22, 2014.After having committed to Michigan as the 135th ranked prospect of the national class of 2014 in October 2013, Wilson's ranking rose to 86th by April 2014 according to Rivals.Prior to the 2014–15 season, Wilson had surgery on his little finger,and he was sidelined during some of the offseason and the August 15 — 24 four-game exhibition tour of Italy.Upon his arrival, he was diagnosed with valgus deformity (""knock-kneed""), and his neuromuscular therapy would eventually increase his vertical jump by 8 inches (20 cm) during his college career.During the fifth game of the season for the 2014–15 team against Villanova in the 2014 Legends Classic, Wilson was injured when he was blocked and knocked down on a slam dunk attempt against Dylan Ennis. He was sidelined due to a sprained knee and eventually missed the remainder of the season. Ennis later transferred to play at Oregon. On December 19, 2015, Michigan defeated Youngstown State 105–46 with Wilson contributing 12 points on 5–6 shooting. The 59-point win was the second largest in school history. Although Wilson appeared in 26 games for the 2015–16 Wolverines, he only played as many as 10 minutes 5 times. Nevertheless, he finished second on the team in blocked shots with 10, including two in a January 12, 2016 upset of (#3/#3) Maryland. It was Michigan's first win over a top-three nationally ranked opponent at Crisler Center since the 1997–98 team defeated No. 3 Duke, 81–73, on December 13, 1997. In the January 1 Big Ten conference opener against Iowa, Wilson posted a career-high 28 points and 14 rebounds in an 83–86 overtime loss. On February 19, Wilson posted a team-high 16 points, including a game-tying three point field goal, in an overtime 78–83 loss to Minnesota. On March 10, Michigan defeated (#12/#13) Purdue 74–70 in overtime during the quarterfinals of the 2017 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Michigan was led by Wilson with 8 rebounds, 3 blocked shots and a game-high 26 points, which was the second highest single-game scoring performance of the tournament (trailing teammate Derrick Walton's 29-point performance the following day). Wilson averaged 15.3 points per game for Michigan's four games during the Big Ten Tournament, helping the 2016–17 Wolverines emerge as the champion. Wilson averaged 16 points, 3 blocks and 4.3 rebounds in three 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament games, helping Michigan reach the round of sixteen, where the team was eliminated by Ennis' 2016–17 Oregon Ducks. In the NCAA tournament wins against Oklahoma State and Louisville, Wilson went a combined 6–6 from the free throw line in the final 30 seconds of play. His overall averages for 7 postseason games was 15.6 points on 53.8% field goal shooting with 5.0 rebounds and 2.0 blocks. He finished the season as the team's leading rebounder and shot blocker with overall averages of 5.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks.His 203 rebounds were the most by a Wolverine since Mitch McGary 4 years earlier and his 57 blocks were the most in nine seasons (Ekpe Udoh). Following the 2017 NCAA Tournament, he began to appear in various mock draft projections for the 2017 NBA draft. On April 4, 2017, Sports Illustrated projected him as first round selection, and ESPN analyst Eamonn Brennan stated that his awaited decision to enter the draft ""seems like a foregone conclusion"". The local press that covers Michigan, made little mention of the possibility of Wilson departing, however, according to SB Nation's Anthony Broome. At the time, some early pollsters included the 2017–18 Wolverines among the expected preseason top 25 teams, while several pollsters omitted the team from their rankings projections. On April 10, both Wilson and teammate Moe Wagner declared for the draft, but did not hire agents, which gave them until May 24 to withdraw their names and retain their athletic eligibility to return to Michigan. Declaring early allowed him to seek advice from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee by the April 14 application deadline, participate in workouts with NBA teams beginning April 25 and this made him eligible for an invitation to the May 9 — 14 NBA Draft Combine. 57 of the 78 players who declared for the 2016 NBA draft without hiring an agent withdrew their names. On April 30, 2017, Jeff Goodman of ESPN reported that he was invited to the NBA Draft Combine. During the week prior to the NBA Combine, Wilson injured his quadriceps during a workout with the San Antonio Spurs, relegating him to taking part in physical measurements and interviews. Analysts were skeptical about Wilson's readiness for the 2017 draft. Wilson stated during combine interviews that he would not remain in the draft unless he was assured of being a first-rounder and was projected as a late first round selection by sources such as ESPN and DraftExpress. On May 24, Wilson announced he would remain in the draft, ending his Michigan career despite two years of remaining eligibility. On June 22, 2017, Wilson was drafted 17th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2017 NBA draft. Wilson joined a Bucks team that had a short-term hole to fill at power forward as Jabari Parker recovered from a torn ACL. Wilson was the first of four 2016–17 Big Ten Conference players selected in the draft. Wilson signed a rookie scale contract on July 6, the eve of the Bucks' first game in the 2017 NBA Summer League. Wilson debuted on October 20, 2017 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, but did not score or post any other stats. Wilson posted his first rebound on October 29 against the Atlanta Hawks and his first four points against the Oklahoma City Thunder two days later. During the season the Bucks assigned Wilson to their NBA G League affiliate Wisconsin Herd multiple times. Wilson missed the first 22 games of the season with a hamstring injury for the 2018–19 Milwaukee Bucks. Despite being injured and having only 71 minutes of NBA experience, he was still signed for a $3 million third-year option by the Bucks at the October 31 rookie-scale player options deadline. By late November he was able to appear in the G-League for the Wisconsin Herd. He saw limited action in two NBA games in early December, including his December 5 season debut against the Detroit Pistons. He had started in a total six games for the Wisconsin Herd, before being called up again on December 15, 2018 when Ersan Ilyasova had a nose contusion. On December 17 in a 107–104 win against the Pistons, Wilson saw his first meaningful action of the season, including defending against Blake Griffin's time-expiring 27-foot (8.2 m) heave and posting 9 points. On December 19 against the New Orleans Pelicans, he posted a career-high 10 rebounds and another 9 points, while surpassing 20 minutes of playing time for the second consecutive game. On December 27 against the New York Knicks, he posted his first NBA double-double with 14 rebounds and 10 points in 21 minutes. On January 16, he established a new career-high with 13 points against the Memphis Grizzlies. He improved his scoring best on January 31 against the Toronto Raptors by posting 16 points. On March 31, 2019, Wilson made his first career start against the Atlanta Hawks. On April 10, the final night of the season, Wilson posted a career-high 18 points, 17 rebounds and 4 assists against the Oklahoma City Thunder. On October 24, 2019, the Bucks exercised the fourth-year option of Wilson's rookie contract for $4,548,280, extending the contract through the 2020-2021 season.
